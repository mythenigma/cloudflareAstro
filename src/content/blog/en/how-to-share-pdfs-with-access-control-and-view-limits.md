## Why Access Control and View Limits Matter

When you share a PDF online, you lose control over who sees it and how many times it's accessed. Without proper access control and view limits, your documents can be:

- **Shared indefinitely**: Recipients forward links to unauthorized users
- **Accessed unlimited times**: No way to track or limit document usage
- **Downloaded and saved**: Files saved locally and shared outside your control
- **Leaked to competitors**: Sensitive information exposed

**Access control and view limits solve these problems** by giving you granular control over document access.

## Understanding Access Control and View Limits

### What is Access Control?

Access control determines **who** can access your PDF. Common methods include:

- **Email verification**: Only specific email addresses can open the document
- **Password protection**: Users must enter a password to view
- **Phone verification**: SMS verification required
- **Domain restrictions**: Only users from specific email domains
- **IP address restrictions**: Limit access to specific locations

### What are View Limits?

View limits control **how many times** a PDF can be accessed:

- **Total view limit**: Document can only be opened X times total
- **Per-user view limit**: Each user can only open X times
- **Time-based limits**: Access expires after a certain date
- **Session limits**: Limit viewing duration per session

## Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Access Control and View Limits

### Step 1: Choose a Platform with Access Control Features

Not all PDF sharing tools offer access control and view limits. Look for:

- ✅ Email-based access control
- ✅ View limit configuration
- ✅ Expiration date settings
- ✅ Password protection
- ✅ Access logging and analytics

**MaiPDF** provides all these features for free, with no registration required.

### Step 2: Upload Your PDF

![Upload Interface](/maipdf-images/upload_section.png)

1. Go to your secure PDF sharing platform
2. Click "Upload PDF" or drag and drop your file
3. Wait for upload to complete

### Step 3: Configure Access Control Settings

![Security Settings Interface](/maipdf-images/settings_in_cloudshare.png)

**Email-Based Access Control:**

1. **Enable email verification**
   - Toggle "Require email verification" ON
   - Enter allowed email addresses (one per line)
   - Or allow any email but require verification

2. **Set domain restrictions** (optional)
   - Only allow emails from specific domains
   - Example: Only @company.com emails can access

3. **Add password protection** (optional)
   - Set a password for additional security
   - Share password separately via secure channel

**Phone Verification** (if available):

1. Enable "Require phone verification"
2. Recipients must verify their phone number via SMS
3. Adds extra layer of security

### Step 4: Configure View Limits

**Total View Limit:**

1. Enable "Limit total views"
2. Set maximum number of times PDF can be opened
   - Example: 5 views total
   - Once limit is reached, link becomes inactive

**Per-User View Limit:**

1. Enable "Limit views per user"
2. Set maximum views per email address
   - Example: Each user can view 3 times
   - Prevents single user from exhausting all views

**Time-Based Limits:**

1. Set "Expiration date"
   - Choose specific date and time
   - Link automatically expires after this date
   - Example: Expires in 7 days

**Combined Limits Example:**
- Total views: 10
- Views per user: 2
- Expiration: 14 days from now

This means:
- Maximum 10 total views across all users
- Each user can view maximum 2 times
- Link expires in 14 days (whichever comes first)

### Step 5: Configure Additional Security Settings

While setting up access control, also enable:

**Download Prevention:**
- Disable download button
- Prevent right-click save
- Block printing

**Watermarking:**
- Add dynamic watermarks with viewer information
- Display email address, IP, or viewing time

**Access Notifications:**
- Get email alerts when document is accessed
- Track all viewing activity

### Step 6: Generate and Share Your Secure Link

![Result with Secure Link](/maipdf-images/result_link_qr_cloudshare.png)

1. Review all settings
2. Click "Generate Link" or "Create Shareable Link"
3. Copy the secure link
4. Share via email, messaging, or embed in website
5. Optionally download QR code for offline sharing

**Result**: Maximum security with single-view access and strong authentication.

### Use Case 4: Marketing Materials

**Scenario**: Sharing marketing PDFs with leads

**Access Control Setup:**
- Email verification: ✅ Required (to capture leads)
- View limit: Unlimited per user, 100 total views
- Expiration: 90 days
- Download prevention: ❌ Disabled (allow sharing)

**Result**: Capture leads while allowing some sharing for marketing purposes.

## Best Practices for Access Control and View Limits

### 1. Set Appropriate View Limits

**Too Restrictive:**
- ❌ 1 view total for a 50-page document
- ❌ 1 view per user for training materials
- ❌ Very short expiration (1 day) for complex documents

**Too Permissive:**
- ❌ Unlimited views for confidential documents
- ❌ No expiration for time-sensitive materials
- ❌ No per-user limits allowing single user to exhaust views

**Best Practice:**
- ✅ 3-5 views per user for most documents
- ✅ 10-20 total views for small groups
- ✅ 7-14 day expiration for most use cases
- ✅ Adjust based on document type and sensitivity

### 2. Use Layered Security

Don't rely on a single security measure:

**Weak Security:**
- ❌ Only password (can be shared)
- ❌ Only view limits (no access control)
- ❌ Only expiration (no view limits)

**Strong Security:**
- ✅ Email verification + view limits + expiration
- ✅ Password + access control + download prevention
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication for sensitive documents

### 3. Communicate Limits to Recipients

**Before Sharing:**
- Inform recipients about view limits
- Explain expiration dates
- Provide password securely
- Set expectations about access

**Example Message:**
> "I'm sharing a confidential document with you. The link allows 3 views and expires in 7 days. Please use it carefully. Password: [shared via secure channel]"

### 4. Monitor Access Activity

**Track:**
- Who accessed the document
- When it was accessed
- How many views remaining
- Any suspicious activity

**Act on:**
- Unusual access patterns
- Views from unexpected locations
- Multiple failed access attempts
- Views approaching limits

### 5. Adjust Limits Based on Feedback

**Monitor:**
- Are recipients running out of views?
- Are expiration dates too short?
- Are access controls too restrictive?

**Adjust:**
- Increase view limits if needed
- Extend expiration dates
- Relax restrictions for trusted recipients

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Setting View Limits

**Problem**: Unlimited views allow excessive access
- Recipients can view hundreds of times
- No control over document usage
- Difficult to track who's accessing

**Solution**: Always set appropriate view limits based on document type

### Mistake 2: Too Restrictive Limits

**Problem**: Limits too low cause user frustration
- Users run out of views before finishing document
- Need to request additional access
- Poor user experience

**Solution**: Set reasonable limits (3-5 views per user for most documents)

### Mistake 3: No Expiration Dates

**Problem**: Links remain active indefinitely
- Old links can be accessed years later
- No automatic cleanup
- Security risk from forgotten links

**Solution**: Always set expiration dates (7-30 days for most use cases)

### Mistake 4: Weak Access Control

**Problem**: Only using passwords without email verification
- Passwords can be shared easily
- No way to track who accessed
- No accountability

**Solution**: Use email verification + password for stronger security

### Mistake 5: Not Monitoring Access

**Problem**: Setting limits but not tracking usage
- Don't know when limits are reached
- Can't identify suspicious activity
- Miss opportunities to adjust settings

**Solution**: Regularly check access logs and analytics

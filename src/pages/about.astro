  <p>
    MaiPDF was founded in 2019, offering users a solution for securely sharing PDF files. While the platform has been continuously developed and refined, it has not yet gained widespread recognition. Over time, we’ve focused on research and development to improve the platform and provide users with a robust and reliable service.
  </p>

  <p>
    MaiPDF provides both online and offline modes for PDF sharing. The online mode allows you to generate links for your PDFs, giving you control over the number of views, download restrictions, and even email verification codes to access the PDF. Meanwhile, the offline mode ensures privacy by embedding PDFs within HTML pages, which can be downloaded and viewed without leaving a trace on the server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although MaiPDF has been steadily growing, we’re still in the development phase. The core functionalities of the online version are now stable, and we plan to migrate to faster servers to improve speed and user experience. We are also committed to releasing more informative articles like this one to help users better understand our platform and explore its full potential.

  <p>
    In addition to MaiPDF, we also operate <a href="https://privnote.chat" target="_blank">privnote.chat</a>, a platform offering encrypted, self-destructive messages for enhanced privacy. Unlike the traditional <a href="https://privnote.com" target="_blank">privnote.com</a>, privnote.chat goes a step further by integrating zero-width character encryption and the ability to encode messages into binary (0 and 1). This extra layer of security ensures that your information is transmitted securely and can be set to self-destruct after being read.

  <p>
    Furthermore, we manage <a href="https://iplogger.icu" target="_blank">iplogger.icu</a>, a site that helps track IP addresses and provides additional insights about website visitors. With the growing interest in digital privacy, iplogger.icu has gained traction, and we aim to offer more features for users who seek enhanced tracking and analytics options.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stay tuned as we continue to enhance MaiPDF, privnote.chat, and iplogger.icu, and thank you for being part of this journey. If you’re new to any of these platforms, feel free to explore and get started with securely sharing your PDFs, messages, and tracking website visitors!

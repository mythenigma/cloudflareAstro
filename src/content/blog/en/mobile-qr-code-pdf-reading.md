# Mobile QR-to-PDF Reading: Fast Setup for Offline-to-Online Sharing

QR is still the fastest bridge from offline material to mobile reading. Instead of sending files in chat groups, you can put one QR code on posters, handouts, booths, or packaging and let visitors open the PDF in browser immediately.

## Why QR works better on mobile

- No file transfer flow (`send -> download -> open`)
- No app dependency for viewers
- Better for temporary visitors and public campaigns
- Easier to reuse across print + social

## Quick setup in 4 steps

1. Upload PDF in MaiPDF.
2. Configure controls (view limit, expiry, download permission).
3. Generate share link and QR code.
4. Test scan on iOS + Android before publishing.

## Recommended control presets

### Public brochure

- Download: allowed
- View limit: high
- Expiry: optional
- Goal: reduce friction

### Partner deck

- Download: off
- View limit: medium
- Expiry: short window
- Goal: avoid uncontrolled redistribution

### Internal handout

- Download: off
- View limit: low
- Expiry: strict
- Goal: short-lived, controlled access

## Offline distribution checklist

- Print QR with enough contrast and clear margin
- Keep QR size readable at expected distance
- Add fallback short URL under the code
- Label expected file size/page count near QR
- Re-test code after every PDF replacement

## Open statistics you should watch

- Total opens by campaign/location
- Open time windows (for staffing and promotion timing)
- Device split (mobile vs desktop)
- Expired/blocked open attempts

These metrics help you optimize distribution without using sensitive wording or surveillance-style claims.

## Common mistakes

- Releasing QR before phone testing
- Using one permanent link for all campaigns
- Allowing download for confidential PDFs
- No expiry for temporary materials

## Use cases

- Event agenda and speaker deck
- Product instruction and onboarding kit
- Real-estate brochure at open houses
- Training manual in classrooms or workshops

## Final takeaway

For mobile-first sharing, QR-to-PDF is the cleanest default: scan, open, read. Keep controls simple, monitor open statistics, and rotate links by campaign for better security and clearer performance data.

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Need to share a PDF but worried about it being viewed by too many people?</p>

## Why Limit PDF Views?

View restrictions help you maintain control over your documents by:

- Ensuring content is only viewed by intended recipients
- Creating urgency with "limited access" strategies
- Reducing the risk of unauthorized distribution

This approach is particularly useful for confidential reports, pricing documents, or any content with limited-time relevance.

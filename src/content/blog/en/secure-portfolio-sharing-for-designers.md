- 📊 **Engagement tracking**: Understanding which designs capture attention
- 🛑 **Usage control**: Preventing downloads of high-resolution assets

- Limited insight into how viewers engage with designs
- Potential for unauthorized downloads

### Email Attachments
- No tracking after sending
- Easy forwarding to unauthorized parties
- Large files get blocked or lost
- No expiration control

### General Cloud Storage
- Links can be shared broadly
- Limited protection from downloads
- No usage analytics
- Difficult to revoke access

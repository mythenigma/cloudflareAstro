# Maiimg Bulk Image Sharing: Complete Guide to Sharing Multiple Images Securely

Use this workflow when you need to send many images quickly while keeping access under control.

## When Bulk Sharing Is Better

Bulk sharing is a better fit than one-by-one links when you need:

- One gallery URL for a full set.
- Shared settings across all images.
- Faster publishing for teams and events.
- Cleaner follow-up using one access record.

## What You Get in One Gallery

- Up to 25 images per upload.
- One share link + one QR code.
- Optional view limits and expiry.
- Optional duration control.
- Open statistics in one place.

## Setup Workflow (5 Steps)

1. Select a focused image set (same topic, audience, or campaign).
2. Upload all files in one pass.
3. Configure controls (views, expiry, duration).
4. Generate link + QR code.
5. Share and monitor open statistics.

## Suggested Settings by Scenario

| Scenario | View limit | Expiry | Downloads |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client draft review | Low-medium | 7-14 days | Optional |
| Internal team handoff | Medium | 7-30 days | Optional |
| Sales/partner asset pack | Medium-high | 30-90 days | Usually on |
| Event photo drop | High | 7-30 days | Optional |

## Distribution Playbook

### Direct link

- Best for email and chat threads.
- Keep one link per audience segment.
- Add a short note: purpose, expiry, and expected action.

### QR code

- Best for in-person access (meetings, booths, classrooms, events).
- Place where people can scan comfortably (slide footer, card, poster).
- Test from two phones before publishing.

## Operational Rules That Reduce Mistakes

- Keep each gallery to one clear purpose.
- Avoid mixed audiences in the same link.
- Set expiry before sending, not after.
- Update settings first, then resend only if needed.
- Delete stale galleries instead of leaving long-lived links.

## Common Problems and Fixes

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Opens are lower than expected | Link buried in long message | Resend with short CTA + QR |
| Too many unauthorized opens | Link forwarded | Reduce view limit, shorten expiry |
| Recipients ask for “latest files” | Mixed versions in one gallery | Split by version/date and rename clearly |
| Team can’t tell which set was used | Weak naming | Use structured naming (`Project_Audience_Date`) |

## Bottom Line

Maiimg bulk sharing is most effective when you treat one gallery as one delivery unit: focused files, clear settings, and one distribution path.

# MaiPDF Print Restriction Settings Guide

Print restriction is useful when paper copies create compliance or leakage risk.

## Practical baseline

- Print: off for sensitive docs
- Download: off for controlled review
- Expiry: always set for temporary access
- Watermark: Visitor ID for accountability

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF and open settings.
2. Disable print and download.
3. Set expiry and open limit.
4. Share audience-specific link.
5. Review open logs and revoke when needed.

## Final takeaway

Print restriction should be part of a layered policy, not a standalone control.

# Send Design Feedback Files with View Limits

Early-stage design files should be reviewed, not redistributed.

## Feedback workflow

1. Upload review PDF.
2. Set view limits and expiry.
3. Disable download for draft iterations.
4. Share reviewer-specific links.
5. Close link after feedback window.

## Final takeaway

View-limited links keep design review focused and reduce leak risk for unfinished work.

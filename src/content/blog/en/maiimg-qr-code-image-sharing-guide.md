<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Use QR sharing when viewers are on phones and you need near-zero friction access to an image gallery.</p>

## When QR Is the Right Channel

QR code distribution works best for:

- Offline-to-online handoff (events, print cards, booths).
- Group access where typing URLs is slow.
- Temporary galleries with a clear deadline.
- Mixed audiences using different devices.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. Upload and organize images into one clear gallery.
2. Configure view limits and expiry.
3. Generate link and QR code together.
4. Place QR code in the distribution context.
5. Monitor open statistics and close when done.

## Placement Rules That Improve Scan Rate

- Keep enough white space around the code.
- Avoid low-contrast backgrounds.
- Put a one-line action label near the code.
- Test scanning distance before publishing.

## Common Placement Scenarios

| Scenario | Placement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Presentation | Last slide or corner strip | Keep short instruction text |
| Event booth | Poster + desk card | Ensure code is not too small |
| Printed handout | Footer area | Leave margin around code |
| Internal workshop | Whiteboard/screen | Include expiry note |

## Access-Control Pairing (Recommended)

Use QR with access rules, not alone:

- Public-ish materials: higher limit + clear expiry.
- Client previews: moderate limit + shorter expiry.
- Sensitive references: low limit + short duration.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Many scans, few completions | Gallery takes too long to load | Reduce image count per gallery |
| Wrong audience opens link | QR leaked outside intended context | Use tighter expiry/view limit |
| Users report failed scans | Contrast/size placement issue | Reprint with larger code and more margin |
| Access ends too early | Limits too strict | Increase view limit or extend expiry |

## Bottom Line

QR sharing is strongest when combined with clear placement, audience-specific links, and short-lived access settings.

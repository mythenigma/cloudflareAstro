# Prevent PDF Downloads: View-Only Sharing

View-only mode is a practical control for draft and sensitive documents.

## Setup

1. Upload PDF.
2. Disable download.
3. Add expiry + open limits.
4. Share controlled link.

## Final takeaway

View-only works best when combined with lifecycle controls, not alone.

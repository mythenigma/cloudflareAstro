# Image Encryption to Reduce Forwarding Risk

Forwarding cannot be eliminated in every case, but you can reduce exposure with layered controls and short content lifecycles.

## Control stack that works

- Protected access (verification/password when needed)
- Link expiry for temporary content
- Download restrictions for sensitive images
- Visitor ID watermark on viewed assets
- Audience-specific links instead of one public link

## Recommended presets

### Client preview assets

- Download: off
- Expiry: 3-7 days
- Watermark: on

### Campaign collaboration assets

- Download: optional
- Expiry: 14-30 days
- Separate links by partner

### Public promotional images

- Download: on
- Expiry: optional
- No sensitive overlays

## Incident response playbook

1. Disable compromised link.
2. Issue new link to approved recipients.
3. Review open logs and timing.
4. Shorten expiry policy for next release.

## Common mistakes

- One permanent link reused across all stakeholders
- No expiry on private previews
- Watermark enabled but not readable on image areas

## Final takeaway

For image security, short-lived links and audience segmentation matter as much as encryption settings. Keep both in policy.

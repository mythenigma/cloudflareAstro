<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>MaiPDF is most useful when your priority is controlled sharing, not permanent public file hosting.</p>

## What MaiPDF Does Well

- Link-based PDF delivery without attachment friction.
- Access controls: view limits, expiry, optional download restriction.
- Open statistics for response timing and engagement checks.
- Fast revoke path when a link should be closed.

## Where It Fits Best

- Sales proposals and commercial offers.
- Client-facing draft and review cycles.
- Team distribution of time-limited documents.
- Campaign or event materials with clear expiry.

## Where It Is Not Ideal

- Permanent public archives.
- Highly specialized enterprise governance stacks.
- Workflows requiring deep custom compliance integrations.

## Decision Checklist

- Need to control access after sharing? -> good fit.
- Need temporary links with clear expiry? -> good fit.
- Need only permanent open hosting? -> consider simpler static hosting.

## Bottom Line

MaiPDF is a practical choice when you want tighter control over who opens a document, for how long, and under what policy.

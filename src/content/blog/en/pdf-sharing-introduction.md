# MaiPDF Introduction: Fast and Controlled PDF Sharing

MaiPDF is built for one job: turn PDFs into controlled links that are easy to open and easy to manage.

## Core capabilities

- Upload PDF and generate link quickly
- Download on/off control
- Open-count limits
- Expiry windows
- Optional verification for protected access
- Open statistics and open logs

## Standard workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Set access controls.
3. Generate link + QR.
4. Share by channel.
5. Monitor opens and adjust policy.

## Where teams use it

- Sales proposals and decks
- Contracts and compliance docs
- Internal training and policy files
- Portfolio and credential sharing

## Practical operating rules

- Use separate links per audience segment
- Set expiry by default for non-permanent docs
- Keep download off for sensitive material
- Rotate links after major file revisions

## Why link-first beats attachment-first

- Fewer version conflicts
- Better mobile viewing
- Faster revoke/disable
- Clearer post-send visibility

## Final takeaway

MaiPDF works best when you keep policy simple and consistent: small set of controls, clear expiry, and audience-specific links.

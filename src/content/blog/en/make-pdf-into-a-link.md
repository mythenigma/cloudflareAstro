# Make PDF Into a Link: Fast Practical Workflow

Link conversion is the simplest way to modernize PDF sharing.

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Generate share link.
3. Set expiry/open limits.
4. Share to recipients.

## Why this is better than attachments

- Better mobile access
- Cleaner version control
- Easier post-send control

## Final takeaway

Use link conversion as default and add policy controls before distribution.

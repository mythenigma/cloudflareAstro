# Maiimg Quick Image Sharing Guide

Fast image sharing should remain structured and controlled.

## 3-step workflow

1. Batch upload images.
2. Generate gallery link + QR.
3. Share with expiry/access policy.

## Practical defaults

- Separate galleries by audience or campaign
- Set expiry for temporary assets
- Disable link when campaign ends

## Final takeaway

Quick sharing works best when lifecycle policy is set before distribution.

# PDF Link Sharing: A Better Alternative to Email Attachments

Attachments are slow to manage, hard to revoke, and easy to forward. Controlled PDF links solve these problems with less friction.

## Why links are operationally better

- One source of truth (no version confusion)
- Better mobile reading experience
- Easy revoke/expiry controls
- Cleaner distribution across email/chat/web

## Migration pattern for teams

1. Keep attachments for fallback only.
2. Make links the default in outbound messages.
3. Add expiry + view-limit presets by document type.
4. Train teams on one-page sharing checklist.

## Template by use case

- Public info: download on, long expiry
- Client review: download off, medium expiry
- Confidential: download off, short expiry, watermark on

## Final takeaway

Switching from attachments to controlled links improves speed and security at the same time, with less operational overhead.

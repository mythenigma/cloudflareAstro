# Free Secure PDF Sharing Tool: Complete Guide

Free sharing should not mean zero control. Use this guide to set up a low-friction, policy-safe workflow.

## What "Secure" Should Include

- Access limits (views or expiry)
- Download control (allow or block)
- Optional watermarking for sensitive files
- Open stats for follow-up and audit

## Core Features

- Share link and QR code
- Expiration and/or max opens
- View-only mode
- Dynamic watermark options
- Activity logs and exportable reports

## Setup Workflow

1. Upload the PDF to the sharing tool.
2. Set access rules: expiry, open limit, optional passcode.
3. Choose download policy (on/off).
4. Enable watermark if the document is confidential.
5. Generate link or QR and run a mobile + desktop test.

## Attachments vs Share Links

| Need | Email Attachment | Secure Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control access | ❌ | ✅ |
| Update after sending | ❌ | ✅ |
| Open statistics | ❌ | ✅ |
| Avoid file size limits | ❌ | ✅ |

## Common Use Cases

- Sales proposals and client decks
- HR and policy documents
- Education/training content
- Portfolio and resume delivery

## Summary

Use share links instead of attachments, then apply simple controls: expiry, open limits, download policy, and watermarking when needed.  
This gives you free distribution with professional-level control.

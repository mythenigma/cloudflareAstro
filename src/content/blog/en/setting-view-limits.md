# Setting View Limits for PDF Links

View limits are a direct control for reducing over-sharing.

## Simple templates

- Low limit: confidential review
- Medium limit: client/stakeholder circulation
- High limit: broad internal distribution

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Set view limit.
3. Add expiry and optional download control.
4. Share segment-specific links.
5. Rotate link after policy changes.

## Final takeaway

Set limits before sharing. It is easier than trying to recover control later.

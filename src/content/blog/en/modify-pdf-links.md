# Replace a PDF Without Changing the Link

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>If you fix content after distribution, keeping the same link prevents version confusion and repeated resend cycles.</p>
</div>

## Why This Matters

- Recipients keep one stable URL.
- You avoid “which file is latest?” threads.
- Access policy can remain consistent across updates.

## Typical Use Cases

- Proposal revision after client feedback.
- Correcting numbers in a report.
- Updating policy documents without redistributing links.
- Replacing expired content under the same delivery path.

## Simple Update Workflow

1. Open the existing shared file in dashboard.
2. Replace source PDF while retaining the same link.
3. Recheck access settings.
4. Notify recipients only if policy changed.

## Good Practices

- Keep a clear internal version note.
- Revalidate key pages after replacement.
- Do not change access policy silently for critical docs.

## Bottom Line

Stable links plus controlled replacement reduce communication overhead and improve recipient clarity.

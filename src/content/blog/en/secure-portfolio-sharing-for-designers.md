# Secure Portfolio Sharing for Designers

Design portfolios need strong presentation and controlled distribution. Link-based sharing gives both with less friction.

## Portfolio security baseline

- Separate portfolio versions by audience type
- Use expiry for hiring/review cycles
- Keep download off for sensitive concepts
- Enable watermark for client-exclusive work

## Sharing presets

### Recruiter submissions

- Download: optional
- Expiry: 14-30 days
- Open limit: medium/high

### Client proposal work

- Download: off
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Open limit: medium

## Workflow

1. Upload role-specific portfolio version.
2. Apply preset policy.
3. Share controlled link.
4. Review open statistics before follow-up.
5. Rotate link after portfolio updates.

## Final takeaway

For designers, secure sharing is part of professional positioning: focused portfolio, clear access window, and controlled distribution.

# Temporary PDF Sharing Links

Sometimes you need to share a PDF for a short time without losing control. Instead of re-sending files, you can share one link and set clear limits.

This guide explains how temporary links work in MaiPDF: you decide how many times the file can be opened and whether downloads are allowed. When the limit is reached, the link stops working.

## Why use temporary links

- **Business docs**: limit views for proposals or quotes
- **Training files**: allow viewing without downloads
- **Short‑term access**: stop the link after a few opens
- **Sensitive content**: keep sharing controlled

## Detailed Feature Introduction

### Upload and generate a link

Upload your PDF, then generate a sharing link and QR code.

After upload, you get a unique link for this file.

### Access limit (number of opens)

Set how many times the link can be opened:

- **Single open** for one recipient
- **A few opens** (3–10) for small sharing
- **Higher limits** when needed

When the limit is reached, the link stops working.

### Download control

Choose between:

- **Allow download** (offline use/printing)
- **View‑only** (no local file)

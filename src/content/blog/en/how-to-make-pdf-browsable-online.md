## Why Browser-View Links Work Better

- No attachment size friction.
- One link works across devices.
- Easier to set access windows and limits.
- Easier to follow up using open statistics.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Upload PDF to a browser-view platform.
2. Set policy (expiry, view count, optional download restriction).
3. Generate link and QR code.
4. Share by channel (email/chat/meeting slide).
5. Review open statistics and close stale links.

## Recommended Settings by Scenario

| Scenario | View limit | Expiry | Download |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client proposal | Low-medium | 3-14 days | Usually off |
| Team handoff | Medium | 7-30 days | Optional |
| Training material | Medium-high | 30-90 days | Optional |

## Common Mistakes

- Sending links before policy setup.
- Using one link for multiple unrelated audiences.
- Ignoring mobile readability during testing.

## Bottom Line

Making PDFs browsable online is mainly an operations upgrade: faster distribution with clearer control boundaries.

# Maiimg: Simple Image Sharing with QR Codes

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p><strong>Maiimg in one line:</strong> upload a small image set, get one share link + one QR code, and control access from one place.</p>
</div>

![Upload Interface](/maiimg/maiimg-head.png)

## Core Features

- Upload up to 25 images per gallery.
- Generate one share link and one QR code.
- Set optional view limits and expiry.
- Check open statistics from one dashboard.
- Delete a gallery any time.

## 3-Step Setup

1. Upload selected images.
2. Set access rules (views, duration, description).
3. Share by link or QR code.

## Best-Fit Use Cases

<div class="features-grid">
  <div class="card"><strong>Client previews</strong><br/>Share drafts with controlled access.</div>
  <div class="card"><strong>Events</strong><br/>Show a QR code on screen for fast guest access.</div>
  <div class="card"><strong>Sales materials</strong><br/>Distribute image packs without large attachments.</div>
  <div class="card"><strong>Teaching</strong><br/>Share temporary references for classes or workshops.</div>
</div>

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not prevent screenshots or camera captures.
- It does not provide advanced enterprise identity controls.
- It is best for practical sharing, not high-security forensic control.

## Quick Checklist Before Sharing

- Keep one gallery focused on one topic.
- Set an expiry date for temporary content.
- Use view limits for sensitive previews.
- Confirm the QR code on mobile before sending.

## Bottom Line

Maiimg is a lightweight image-sharing workflow: fast upload, clean sharing, basic access control, and clear open statistics.

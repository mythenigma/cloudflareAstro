## What "generation" means in Maiimg

When you upload images and create a gallery, Maiimg automatically generates a shareable link. The QR code is a scannable form of that link, optimized for quick access on mobile devices.

## Step-by-step: generate the QR code

1. Upload images and create a gallery.
2. Configure access controls (optional but recommended).
3. Generate the share link and QR code in the share panel.
4. Download the QR code image for printing or digital use.

## Settings that affect the QR code outcome

- **Access limits**: view limits and expiration can make the QR code time-bound.
- **Security options**: password or verification can add a gate before viewing.
- **Gallery updates**: updating images keeps the QR code valid while the link stays the same.

## Output formats and usage

- **PNG**: best for print, posters, or signage.
- **Digital sharing**: embed in slides, PDFs, or event pages.

## Scan quality checklist

- Keep a clear margin around the QR code.
- Avoid placing it on busy backgrounds.
- Ensure the print size is large enough for the viewing distance.

## Common troubleshooting

- **Does not scan**: increase size or contrast and re-download.
- **Opens but shows no images**: confirm access settings and expiration.
- **People see access blocked**: verify password or verification steps.

## Key takeaways

- Generation is automatic after creating the share link.
- Access controls change how people experience the QR code.
- A clean, high-contrast print is the fastest way to reduce scan failures.

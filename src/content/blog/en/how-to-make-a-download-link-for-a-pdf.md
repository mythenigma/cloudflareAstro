# How to Make a Download Link for a PDF

If recipients need local files, a download link is cleaner than large attachments and easier to manage.

## Fast setup (5 steps)

1. Upload the PDF.
2. Enable `download allowed`.
3. Set expiry and open limit.
4. Generate link and test once.
5. Share via email/chat/site.

## Recommended presets

### Public resource

- Download: on
- Expiry: optional
- Open limit: high

### Client handoff

- Download: on
- Expiry: 7-30 days
- Open limit: medium

### Controlled distribution

- Download: on
- Expiry: short
- Open limit: low
- Watermark: Visitor ID

## Quality checklist before sending

- Verify file is final version
- Test link in incognito mode
- Confirm mobile open and download behavior
- Add filename conventions for recipients

## Final takeaway

Download links are best for deliberate file handoff. Keep lifecycle controls active so shared files do not remain open-ended.

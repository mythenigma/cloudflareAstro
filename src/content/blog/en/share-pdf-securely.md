# How to Share PDFs Securely with MaiPDF

Secure PDF sharing is mostly about predictable policy, not complicated setup.

## Fast secure workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate controlled link.
2. Set download/print policy.
3. Add expiry and open limit.
4. Enable Visitor ID watermark when needed.
5. Share per audience segment, not one global link.

## Recommended presets

### General distribution

- Download: on
- Expiry: optional
- Open limit: high

### Client review

- Download: off
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Open limit: medium

### Confidential file

- Download: off
- Expiry: 3-7 days
- Open limit: low
- Watermark: on

## Final takeaway

Secure sharing should be repeatable. Use fixed templates, short lifecycles, and quick revoke actions when scope changes.

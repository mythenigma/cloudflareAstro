# 👀 Let People View Your PDF—But Not Download It

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>You want someone to see your PDF.</p>
  <p>But not keep it. Not forward it. Not store it forever.</p>
  <p>That's a reasonable ask—but most standard file-sharing methods don't give you that kind of control. Attachments get saved, cloud links get downloaded, and before you know it, your file is out in the wild.</p>
  <p>So what if you could let people view your PDF securely online—with no download option?</p>
</div>

## 📦 The Problem with Traditional Sharing

![PDF sharing via link and QR code](/maipdf-images/result of pdf link and qr code.png)

When you send a PDF through:

- 📧 **Email** – the file is instantly downloadable
- ☁️ **Cloud links** – download is usually just one click away
- 📲 **Messaging apps** – the file often auto-saves locally

Once the file is downloaded, you lose control. There's no "undo."

## 🔒 View-Only Sharing: What It Means

![PDF browser view without download option](/maipdf-images/pdf native view on ui.png)

A view-only PDF setup allows recipients to:

- Open the file in their browser
- Read the content
- Zoom, scroll, and interact—but not download or save the file itself

This is achieved through:

- A hosted version of the file (not sent directly)
- Viewer restrictions on the server side
- Optional limits on view counts or time

Think of it like streaming a movie instead of sending someone the full video file.

## 🎯 Why You'd Want This

    <h3>Confidential Reports</h3>
    <p>Share sensitive information without leaving digital copies behind</p>

    <div class="feature-icon">📊</div>

  </div>
</div>

View-only sharing is especially valuable when you don't fully trust the recipient to handle the file responsibly.

## 🛠 How Platforms Make It Happen

![Security settings interface](/maipdf-images/security setting.png)

Tools that support view-only PDF sharing often include features like:

- No download toggle
- No print / copy restrictions
- Limited view counts
- Access logs to track when the file is opened
- Remote disable options

Some platforms even allow you to revoke access or change settings after the file is shared.

## 📌 How MaiPDF Handles It

![PDF viewing restrictions icons](/maipdf-images/pdf icon of no printing no downloading.png)

On MaiPDF, when you upload a PDF:

- The file is stored in the cloud
- You get a read-only access link
- Recipients can view the file online, but cannot download it

You can also:

<div class="note-box">
  <ul>
    <li>Limit the number of times it can be opened</li>
    <li>Track IP and open time</li>
    <li>Disable or update the file anytime using your edit code</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This makes it simple to share a file without giving it away. The document stays under your control—even after it's been sent.

## 🔐 Enhanced View-Only Security

For additional protection, you can combine view-only sharing with email verification:

![Email verification for PDF access](/maipdf-images/get email verification before read.jpg)

This ensures that only authorized recipients can view your document, adding another layer of security to your view-only setup.

## ⚠️ Keep Expectations Realistic

No-download doesn't mean no-screenshot. A determined user can always take a photo or screen capture.

For maximum security, combine view-only sharing with:

- Access logs
- View limits
- Expiring or single-use links
- Email verification

Think of it as discouraging misuse, not eliminating it completely.

## 📈 Real-World Applications

View-only PDF sharing is valuable in many professional contexts:

### For Sales Teams

- Present proposals that contain proprietary information

### For Legal Professionals
- Share draft contracts that aren't ready for distribution

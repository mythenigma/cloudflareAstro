# Control How Your PDF Link Behaves

Post-send control is the key benefit of link-based distribution.

## Core controls

- View limits
- Manual link disable
- File replacement under same URL

## Practical workflow

1. Set policy before sharing.
2. Monitor open logs.
3. Disable or replace link when business context changes.

## Final takeaway

Treat PDF links as managed assets, not static file sends.

# Auto-Delete Images: Expiration and Cleanup Guide

For temporary media delivery, expiry should be default. It reduces stale links, limits unintended reuse, and keeps storage/workflows clean.

## When to use expiration

- Event photo delivery
- Time-limited promotions
- Review-only client drafts
- Internal temporary announcements

## Recommended expiration presets

### 24-72 hours

- Sensitive previews
- Internal approval drafts

### 7-14 days

- Client handoff galleries
- Campaign collaboration assets

### 30 days

- Public but temporary announcements

## Setup workflow

1. Upload images.
2. Set expiry date/time.
3. Share gallery/direct links.
4. Monitor open statistics.
5. Disable or extend links as needed.

## Operational tips

- Group assets by campaign for easier cleanup
- Add expiry notice in the share message
- Keep one owner for extension decisions
- Export/archive approved versions before expiry

## Common mistakes

- No expiry on temporary content
- Mixing permanent and temporary assets in one gallery
- Forgetting to rotate links after campaign changes

## Final takeaway

Auto-delete is less about deletion itself and more about lifecycle control. Set clear expiry windows and review them as part of normal campaign operations.

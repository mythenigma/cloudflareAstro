# Host PDF Online: Secure Sharing Guide

Online hosting is effective when access policy is defined before distribution.

## Recommended control baseline

- Expiry for temporary sharing
- Open limits by audience size
- Download/print restrictions for sensitive docs
- Watermark for high-risk documents

## Workflow

1. Upload document.
2. Apply policy template.
3. Share controlled link.
4. Monitor open logs.
5. Revoke and rotate links when needed.

## Final takeaway

Secure hosting is mostly operational discipline: template-based settings and fast response on scope changes.

# PDF View Count Limit Settings: Practical Guide

View count limits help prevent unlimited redistribution when a link is forwarded.

## Policy presets

### One-time access

- Use for sensitive approvals or one-off disclosures
- Pair with short expiry and watermark

### Limited access (recommended)

- Use for proposals, client review, and team circulation
- Typical range: 5-50 opens depending on audience size

### High-volume access

- Use for broad distribution documents
- Keep expiry and monitoring enabled

## Operating steps

1. Set document sensitivity level.
2. Choose view-limit preset.
3. Add expiry and download policy.
4. Share segmented links.
5. Rotate link when limit is exhausted or scope changes.

## Final takeaway

View count is a practical guardrail. It works best with expiry and audience-specific links.

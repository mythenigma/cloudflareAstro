# Create Professional Portfolio Links

A portfolio should open fast, look clean on mobile, and avoid uncontrolled forwarding. Link-based sharing does that better than attachments.

## Professional portfolio workflow

1. Export a concise portfolio PDF.
2. Upload and generate link.
3. Set open limit + expiry.
4. Keep download off for selective reviews.
5. Share one link per audience type.

## Audience presets

### Recruiters

- Download: optional
- Expiry: 30 days
- Open limit: high

### Client pitches

- Download: off
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Open limit: medium

### Internal reviewers

- Download: off
- Expiry: short
- Open limit: low

## Presentation checklist

- First page shows best work immediately
- Keep file size reasonable for mobile
- Use short project captions, not long paragraphs
- Update link when portfolio version changes

## Final takeaway

Portfolio links should balance speed and control: easy to open for valid viewers, difficult to redistribute without context.

# Create PDF Links That Actually Get Opened: 5 Practical Strategies

Open rate is usually a delivery problem, not a content problem.

## 5 strategies

1. Use clear link labels (`Q4 Pricing Deck - 3 min`).
2. Send by audience segment, not one generic broadcast.
3. Set short availability windows for time-sensitive files.
4. Keep mobile-first readability (file size + first-page clarity).
5. Follow up based on open statistics timing.

## Quick operating checklist

- Test link in mobile + desktop
- Keep one current version per campaign
- Avoid attachments unless needed as fallback
- Rotate link after major file updates

## Final takeaway

If links are clear, timely, and audience-specific, open rates improve without extra complexity.

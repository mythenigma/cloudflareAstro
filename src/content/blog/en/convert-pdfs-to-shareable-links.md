# Convert Your PDFs into Shareable Links

Email attachments are hard to control after sending.  
Share links are easier to distribute and easier to manage.

## Why Use Share Links

- No file-size limits in email
- One URL for chat, email, or QR
- Optional expiry and open limits
- Optional view-only mode
- Open statistics for follow-up

## Fast Workflow

1. Upload the PDF.
2. Generate link or QR code.
3. Configure policy: expiry, open limit, download on/off.
4. Share with recipients.
5. Review open statistics and adjust if needed.

## Policy Presets

- Public handout: download ON, long expiry
- Sales proposal: download OFF, short expiry
- Draft review: low open limit + watermark
- Internal memo: passcode + medium expiry

## Best-Fit Teams

- Sales and customer success
- Design and product review
- Training and education
- Legal and compliance communication

## Final Takeaway

Convert first, then share.  
A controlled link gives better delivery, cleaner operations, and stronger document governance than attachments.

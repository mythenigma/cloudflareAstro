## Start With Your Usage Model

- Public publishing: long-lived links and broad access.
- Controlled delivery: expiry, view limits, and quick revocation.
- Team distribution: batch upload and consistent policy.

## Evaluation Criteria That Matter

| Criteria | Why it matters | What to check |
|---|---|---|
| Upload and batch flow | Affects daily speed | Multi-file upload, retry stability |
| Link and QR output | Affects distribution friction | Immediate generation, mobile usability |
| Access controls | Defines risk boundary | View limits, expiry, optional session duration |
| Open statistics | Supports follow-up decisions | Open trend and timing visibility |
| Revocation | Limits incident impact | Fast link disable capability |

## Option Types (Short View)

- Public image hosts: easy publishing, limited control.
- Generic cloud links: broad compatibility, limited policy depth.
- Controlled sharing platforms (for example Maiimg): distribution + policy + open statistics in one workflow.

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Primary need | Better fit |
|---|---|
| Long-term public gallery | Public/static hosting |
| Time-limited client review | Controlled-sharing platform |
| Event distribution via phone | QR-ready platform with policy controls |
| Team asset packs | Batch-friendly platform with central settings |

## Selection Method

1. Classify content sensitivity.
2. Define audience size and link lifetime.
3. Select tool by required control level, then price.

## Bottom Line

The best free host is the one that supports your full lifecycle: publish, control, measure, and close.

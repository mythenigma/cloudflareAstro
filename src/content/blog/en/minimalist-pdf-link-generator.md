# Minimalist PDF Link Generator

If the goal is simple sharing, the workflow should be simple too: upload once, set basic controls, share one clean link.

## 30-second flow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Set open limit and expiry.
3. Choose download on/off.
4. Copy link or QR and send.

## What to keep minimal

- Only configure controls needed for this file
- Avoid over-customized settings for routine docs
- Use one link per audience segment when sensitivity is high

## Default presets

### Public resource

- Download: on
- Open limit: high
- Expiry: optional

### Client document

- Download: off
- Open limit: medium
- Expiry: 7-14 days

### Sensitive draft

- Download: off
- Open limit: low
- Expiry: short
- Watermark: Visitor ID

## Why minimalist works

- Faster internal adoption
- Lower setup error rate
- Easier training for non-technical teams
- Cleaner handoff across email/chat/QR channels

## Open statistics to monitor

- Total opens
- Open trend by day
- Invalid-open attempts after expiry

Use these signals to decide whether to extend, rotate, or disable links.

## Final takeaway

Minimal does not mean weak. A small set of high-impact controls gives most teams the best balance of speed, clarity, and document safety.

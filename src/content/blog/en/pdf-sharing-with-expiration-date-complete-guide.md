## Why Use Expiration Dates for PDF Sharing?

Sharing PDFs without expiration dates creates security risks:

**Problems Without Expiration:**
- ❌ Links remain active forever
- ❌ Old documents accessible indefinitely
- ❌ No automatic cleanup
- ❌ Security risk from forgotten links
- ❌ Compliance issues
- ❌ Loss of document control

**Benefits of Expiration Dates:**
- ✅ Automatic link deactivation
- ✅ Time-limited access
- ✅ Security enhancement
- ✅ Compliance support
- ✅ Automatic cleanup
- ✅ Document lifecycle management

## How PDF Expiration Dates Work

### The Mechanism

1. **Set expiration date** when creating PDF link
2. **Link remains active** until expiration date
3. **Automatic deactivation** at expiration time
4. **Access denied** after expiration
5. **No manual deletion** needed

### Expiration Options

**Date and Time:**
- Specific date and time
- Example: "Expires on Dec 31, 2025 at 11:59 PM"
- Precise control

**Duration-Based:**
- Days from creation
- Example: "Expires in 7 days"
- Relative expiration

**Event-Based:**
- Expires after specific event
- Example: "Expires after meeting date"
- Context-dependent

### 2. Communicate Expiration to Recipients

**Before Sharing:**

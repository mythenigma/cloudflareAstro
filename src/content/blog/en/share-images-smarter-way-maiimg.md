# Share Images the Smarter Way with Maiimg

Smarter image sharing means fewer manual steps and better control after sending.

## Practical workflow

1. Batch upload images.
2. Generate one gallery link.
3. Add expiry/access policy.
4. Share link or QR by channel.
5. Review open statistics and retire old links.

## Best-fit scenarios

- Product and campaign asset distribution
- Event photos and recap galleries
- Team collaboration boards
- Training and classroom visuals

## Operating tips

- Keep one gallery per purpose
- Avoid mixing permanent and temporary assets
- Reissue link after major content changes

## Final takeaway

Use links as the default share unit, not files. It keeps distribution clean and easier to manage.

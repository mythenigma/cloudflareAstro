## üíº Risks in Traditional Architectural Document Sharing

Common sharing methods create significant vulnerabilities:

### Email Distribution
- Large files frequently get blocked
- No tracking after sending
- Easy forwarding to unauthorized contractors
- No version control when plans are updated

### Physical Prints
- Difficult to track multiple copies
- Impossible to recall outdated versions
- No record of who viewed the documents
- Expensive and environmentally wasteful

### General File Sharing Services
- Limited security controls
- No watermarking to trace leaks
- Difficult to revoke access when team members change
- No usage analytics

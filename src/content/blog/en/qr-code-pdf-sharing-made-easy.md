# QR Code PDF Sharing Made Easy

QR-based sharing is the fastest way to distribute PDFs in live and offline-to-online contexts.

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Generate link + QR.
3. Apply expiry/open-limit settings.
4. Display QR on screen or print.
5. Disable link after session if needed.

## Final takeaway

Use QR for access speed, and link policy for post-share control.

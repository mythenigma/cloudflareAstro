# Maiimg Complete Introduction: Professional Image Sharing Platform Made Simple and Secure

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Maiimg is a lightweight image-sharing workflow: upload a gallery, apply access rules, share by link/QR, and review open statistics.</p>
</div>

![Maiimg Homepage](/maiimg/maiimg-head.png)

## What Maiimg Solves

Use Maiimg when you need more control than basic file sharing:

- Time-limited access.
- View-limited previews.
- One-click QR distribution.
- Fast sharing without heavy setup.

## Core Capabilities

- Multi-image gallery sharing (up to 25 per upload).
- Link + QR generation in one flow.
- Access rules: view limits, expiry, optional duration.
- Open statistics and easy gallery revocation.

## Typical Use Cases

| Team | Typical goal | Why Maiimg fits |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing | Share campaign image sets | Quick distribution + expiry control |
| Sales | Send proposal visuals | Controlled previews and follow-up timing |
| Creative | Portfolio or draft review | Easy access with low friction |
| Events | Guest photo access | QR-based on-site sharing |

## Quick Start Workflow

1. Upload a focused set of images.
2. Configure access policy.
3. Generate link + QR code.
4. Distribute to the target audience.
5. Review open statistics and adjust.

## Recommended Operating Rules

- One gallery, one purpose.
- One audience segment per link.
- Always set expiry for temporary content.
- Revoke stale links instead of leaving them active.
- Name galleries clearly for future lookup.

## What Maiimg Is Not

- Not a replacement for full DAM suites.
- Not a forensic leak-proof system.
- Not intended for permanent public hosting workflows.

## Bottom Line

Maiimg is designed for practical, controlled sharing: simple setup, fast distribution, and enough control for day-to-day business use.

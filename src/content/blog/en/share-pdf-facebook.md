# Facebook PDF Sharing: Post Professional Document Links

For Facebook distribution, links are usually more effective than file uploads.

## Practical posting workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate share link.
2. Write short post copy with clear call-to-action.
3. Publish link post.
4. Review open statistics by post window.
5. Update or rotate link when content changes.

## Best use cases

- Product sheets and brochures
- Event guides and schedules
- Resource handouts and lead magnets
- Community announcements with attached docs

## Final takeaway

Use one controlled PDF link per campaign message. It keeps posts cleaner and easier to maintain.

# Online vs Offline PDF Security: How to Choose

Online and offline security models solve different problems. Choose by environment constraints, not by feature count alone.

## Online link mode

Best when you need:

- Fast deployment and updates
- Remote revoke/disable
- Open statistics and operational visibility
- Cross-device convenience with no package distribution

Tradeoff:

- Requires reliable network for access

## Offline package mode

Best when you need:

- Access in restricted/unstable networks
- Air-gapped or compliance-constrained delivery
- Portable package distribution via internal channels

Tradeoff:

- No real-time cloud-side visibility while offline
- Policy changes are less immediate than online links

## Decision matrix

Choose online if your top priority is agility and ongoing control.
Choose offline if your top priority is network independence and controlled local operation.

## Implementation checklist

- Define allowed channels (email/chat/internal portal/USB)
- Set lifecycle policy (expiry, versioning, revoke rule)
- Test on actual target devices/browsers
- Document incident response for leaked links/packages

## Final takeaway

Security choice is operational architecture. Pick the model that matches your network reality and response speed requirements.

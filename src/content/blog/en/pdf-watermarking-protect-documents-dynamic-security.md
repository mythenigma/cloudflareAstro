# PDF Watermarking: Dynamic Protection for Shared Documents

Dynamic watermarking adds viewer-specific context to every view, which raises accountability and reduces casual redistribution.

## What to include in watermark content

- Visitor ID
- Access timestamp
- Document classification text
- Optional team/project identifier

## When to enable watermarking

- Proposal and pricing documents
- Pre-release technical or product files
- Legal and compliance review packages
- Investor and board materials

## Recommended policy

- Combine watermark with view-only mode
- Keep expiry enabled for sensitive docs
- Use separate links for each recipient group
- Keep watermark readable but non-blocking

## Common mistakes

- Watermark text too small to be useful
- Watermark used without any lifecycle controls
- One universal link shared across all audiences

## Final takeaway

Watermarking is strongest when paired with controlled links and short access windows. Use it as deterrence plus evidence, not as a standalone control.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Why it matters | What to verify |
|---|---|---|
| Distribution speed | Team productivity | Upload flow, link generation time |
| Policy controls | Risk management | View limits, expiry, download controls |
| Mobile usability | Recipient experience | QR flow, phone readability |
| Open statistics | Follow-up quality | Open trend visibility |
| Link lifecycle | Operational hygiene | Fast revoke/update path |

## Tool Categories

- Generic cloud links: broad compatibility, lighter control.
- Public file hosts: easy publish, less policy depth.
- Controlled-sharing platforms: stronger access and lifecycle control.

## Quick Selection Matrix

| Primary need | Better fit |
|---|---|
| Long-lived open access | Generic/public host |
| Time-limited business sharing | Controlled-sharing platform |
| Frequent external distribution | Link+QR workflow platform |

## Practical Selection Process

1. Define content sensitivity levels.
2. Define link lifetime by use case.
3. Pick the minimum tool complexity that still enforces policy.

## Bottom Line

Choose tools by operational fit: publish, control, measure, and retire links cleanly.

## The Magic of PDF to Link Conversion

Converting a PDF into a link transforms how you share documents. Instead of sending large file attachments, you share a simple URL that provides instant access to your content.

**From This**: Sending a 15MB presentation as an email attachment that bounces back due to size limits.

**To This**: Sharing a clean link like `https://maipdf.com/file/abc123@pdf` that anyone can click to view immediately.

# 🛡️ Safeguard Your PDFs Online—Control Who Views, Shares, or Edits Your Documents

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Protect Sensitive Information Without Complex Software or Costly Tools</p>
  <p>PDFs are a go-to format for sharing important information—business proposals, contracts, reports, internal docs, training materials, and more.</p>
  <p>But once a PDF is sent, it often feels like you've lost control.</p>
</div>

* Anyone can forward it
* Anyone can download and copy it
* You can't stop someone from opening it days, weeks, or years later
* You have no idea who opened it, or when

If that sounds familiar, it's time to safeguard your PDFs.

## ✅ What Does It Mean to "Safeguard" a PDF?

To safeguard a PDF means going beyond password protection or basic encryption.

It means:

* Controlling who can open the file
* Limiting how many times they can view it
* Blocking downloads or copies
* Tracking when and where it's opened
* Being able to modify or revoke access at any time

Think of it as lightweight document security—designed for real-world sharing.

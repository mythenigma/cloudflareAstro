    <div class="step-content">
      <h3>Disable Right-Click</h3>
      <p>A simple way to prevent casual users from downloading a PDF is to disable the right-click functionality on your website. This prevents them from using browser options like "Save As" or "Download".</p>

    <div class="step-number">2</div>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h3>Use a Secure PDF Viewer</h3>
      <p>Embed your PDF files in a secure viewer that restricts downloading. Many third-party tools and libraries allow you to display PDFs in a way that prevents users from downloading or printing them.</p>

    <div class="step-number">3</div>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h3>Watermark Your PDFs</h3>
      <p>If preventing downloads entirely isn't feasible, consider adding visible watermarks to your PDFs. This discourages unauthorized sharing by clearly marking the document as proprietary.</p>

    <div class="step-content">
      <h3>Restrict Access with Authentication</h3>

    <div class="step-content">

# Complete PDF Security: Practical Layered Protection

Complete PDF security is a layered system, not a single feature.

## Four practical layers

- Access: verification and audience segmentation
- Lifecycle: expiry and open limits
- Content: download/print restrictions and watermarking
- Response: open logs and rapid revoke process

## Baseline template

- Sensitive docs: download off + short expiry + watermark on
- Standard business docs: medium limits + clear expiry
- Public docs: high limits + optional expiry

## Final takeaway

Security quality depends on consistency. Use fixed templates and incident playbooks, not ad hoc settings.

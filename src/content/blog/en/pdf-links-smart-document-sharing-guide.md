## Why PDF Links Are Replacing Traditional Sharing Methods

Standard document sharing approaches come with notable limitations:

| Sharing Method | Limitations | Analytics Capabilities |
| :------------- | :---------- | :--------------------- |
| Email attachments | Size limits, delivery issues | No viewing data |
| File transfer services | Temporary access, limited controls | Basic download counts |
| Cloud storage links | Complex permissions, multiple steps | Limited engagement metrics |
| Physical copies | No digital security, distribution tracking | No analytics possible |

**The key advantage:** Smart PDF links combine frictionless access with powerful security features and comprehensive analytics.

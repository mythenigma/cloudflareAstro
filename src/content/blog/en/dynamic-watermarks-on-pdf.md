# Dynamic Watermarks on PDF

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Dynamic watermarks embed viewer-specific information directly into a PDF while it is being read. They discourage leaks, make content traceable, and let you share sensitive documents with more confidence.</p>
</div>

## What is a dynamic watermark?

A dynamic watermark is not a static logo. It changes for each viewer and session, showing details such as email, phone, timestamp, or a unique access ID. If the document is shared without permission, you can identify the source.

## Why dynamic watermarks work

- **Deterrence**: readers are less likely to leak files when their identity is visible.
- **Traceability**: you can map a leaked copy back to a specific viewer.
- **Low friction**: the viewer can still read the document normally.

## When to use them

- Sales proposals and pricing sheets
- Contracts and legal drafts
- Internal training or policy documents
- R&D materials and product roadmaps

## Typical dynamic watermark fields

- Viewer email or phone
- Access time and date
- Unique access ID
- Company or project name

## Recommended setup flow

1. Upload your PDF and create a share link.
2. Enable dynamic watermark in the security settings.
3. Choose the fields you want to display.
4. Test the link to confirm the watermark appears correctly.
5. Share the link or QR code with your audience.

## Best practices

- Use high-contrast watermark text but keep it readable.
- Place the watermark across the center or repeated diagonally.
- Combine with view limits or expiration for extra control.
- Avoid overly long fields that block content.

## Common questions

**Will a screenshot remove the watermark?**  
No. The watermark is rendered on top of the page at view time, so screenshots still capture it.

**Can viewers remove the watermark?**  
Not if they are viewing through a protected online reader. The watermark is baked into the display layer.

## Summary

Dynamic watermarks are one of the fastest ways to make sensitive PDFs safer to share. They add accountability without interrupting the reading experience and pair well with access limits, expiration, and verification.

# 🎨 Send Design Feedback Files With View Limits

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Keep Control of Early-Stage Work—and Who Sees It</p>
  <p>Design is an iterative process. You brainstorm, prototype, present, revise. But before a design is finalized, it often goes through multiple internal reviews, stakeholder feedback loops, or limited user testing.</p>
  <p>In these early stages, sharing a design file can be risky—especially when it's saved, forwarded, or taken out of context.</p>
</div>

So how do you gather feedback without losing control?

**Limit how the file is accessed. Limit how often it's seen.**

## 🧠 The Real Risk of Early-Stage Design Sharing

Imagine this:

- You send a PDF version of a prototype to a reviewer.
- They forward it to another team.
- That person screenshots it.
- Suddenly, your half-done idea is circulating in chats, pitches, or even in front of clients.

Now the narrative is no longer in your hands.

## ✅ The Smarter Way: View-Only Access With Limits

Instead of emailing attachments or open Google Drive links, use a secure platform that allows:

- 📄 View-only sharing (no downloads)
- 🔢 Limited number of opens (e.g. 2 views max)
- ⏱️ Optional access expiry after X hours
- 🧭 Access logs (IP, time, location)
- ❌ No forwarding, no printing

You send a link or QR code, they view it—and that's it. No copies. No confusion. No content spreading beyond your control.

## 🧪 Real Use Case: A UX Team in Review Mode

Your product team is testing 3 homepage layouts.

You want selected stakeholders to:
- View the mockups
- Leave feedback
- But not circulate screenshots to marketing or external partners

So you:
1. Upload the PDF to a secure viewer
2. Allow 3 views max per reviewer
3. Disable downloading
4. Track who opened which file
5. Revoke access after the design direction is locked in

This keeps reviews productive—and your process protected.

## ✅ Final Thought

Design is powerful—but early-stage design is fragile.

By setting view limits and restricting file behavior, you can:

- Gather clean feedback
- Prevent miscommunication
- Keep your work safe, focused, and in the right hands

Because sometimes the best way to protect your best ideas... is to control how long they can be seen.

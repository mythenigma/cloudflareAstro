# Convert PDFs into Shareable Links: Practical Guide

Shareable links provide better control than attachments and generic folder shares.

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Generate link + optional QR.
3. Apply policy (expiry/open limit/download).
4. Share by audience segment.

## Why links are better

- Better mobile reading
- Easier version control
- Fast revoke and rotation

## Final takeaway

Use shareable links as default. Keep settings template-based for consistency.

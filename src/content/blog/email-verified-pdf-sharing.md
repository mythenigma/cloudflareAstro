# Secure PDF Sharing with Email Verification

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Sharing PDFs online can be risky—especially when they contain sensitive information.</p>
  <p>What if your document ends up in the wrong hands?</p>
  <p>Email verification adds an extra security layer, ensuring only intended recipients can access your files.</p>
</div>

## Why Add Email Verification to PDF Sharing?

Standard PDF sharing relies on link access alone—anyone with the link can view the document. Email verification adds an essential security checkpoint by requiring the viewer to:

1. Receive an email with a verification code
2. Enter that code to unlock the document

This simple step dramatically improves document security.

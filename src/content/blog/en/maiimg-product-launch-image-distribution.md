# Maiimg for Product Launches: Image Distribution Playbook

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Product launches rely on synchronized visuals—hero images, feature callouts, lifestyle shots, retail-ready packs. <strong>Maiimg for product launches</strong> creates a single hub where marketing, sales, PR, and channel partners can access the exact images they need with controlled access and real-time tracking.</p>

## Launch-Day Challenges

Product teams face recurring issues when distributing images:

- Multiple stakeholders need coordinated access
- Email attachments get lost or outdated
- Cloud folders expose entire libraries
- Channel partners need localized assets
- Agencies require quick refreshes

Maiimg solves these with a single, trackable gallery per launch.

## Launch Workflow Overview

```
Assets Ready → Bulk Upload → Configure Access → Generate Link + QR → Distribute
```

1. **Assets Ready** – Final images, packaging renders, lifestyle shots
2. **Bulk Upload** – Add up to 25 images per gallery
3. **Configure Access** – Set view limits, expiration, download rules
4. **Generate Link + QR** – One link for digital, QR for printed kits
5. **Distribute** – Send to marketing, sales, PR, retail partners
6. **Monitor** – Track who accessed, when, and from where

## Gallery Structure for Launches

| Asset Type | Description | Recommended Settings |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Hero Images | Flagship visuals used in campaigns | High view limit, longer expiration |
| Feature Shots | Close-ups of product benefits | Medium view limit, 30-day expiration |
| Lifestyle Shots | Contextual imagery for social | Medium view limit, 14-day expiration |
| Packshots | Retail-ready product angles | High view limit, download enabled |
| Retail Kits | QR codes, POS imagery | Password protection, print-ready QR |

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Bulk Upload Assets

- Drag-and-drop up to 25 images (PNG/JPG/WebP)
- Use naming conventions (e.g., `SKU_View_Angle`)
- Create separate galleries per audience if needed

### 2. Set Security Controls

- **View Limits**: 50–100 for marketing teams, 10–20 for agencies
- **Expiration**: Align with campaign phases (pre-launch, launch week, post-launch)
- **Download Rules**: Enable for retail partners, disable for embargoed assets
- **Time Controls**: 60-second viewing window for embargoed previews

### 3. Generate Link + QR Code

- Copy link for email distribution lists
- Download QR code for launch kits, press releases, showroom displays
- Embed QR code in PDF briefs or physical packets

### 4. Segment Distribution

| Audience | Delivery Method | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Marketing Team | Direct link + Slack announcement | High view limits, no password |
| Sales Team | Link embedded in launch brief | Enable downloads for pitch decks |
| PR Agency | Password-protected link | Add expiration after press day |
| Retail Partners | Printed QR + email link | Provide packshots + shelf visuals |
| Influencers | QR code on event invites | Track access to monitor engagement |

### 5. Monitor Access

- Watch total views to confirm engagement
- Identify which assets are most downloaded
- Detect early leaks via location/time patterns
- Disable access immediately if needed

## Best Practices

### Role-Based Galleries

- Create **Marketing**, **Sales**, **PR**, **Retail** galleries
- Tailor settings per role
- Update galleries independently during refreshes

### Embargo Management

- Use short expiration dates for pre-launch access
- Auto-expire galleries at launch to avoid outdated assets
- Replace with live galleries on launch day

### Localization Support

- Duplicate galleries by region
- Include localized packaging shots
- Provide region-specific QR codes
- Track access to confirm delivery

### Launch Retro Analysis

Use Maiimg analytics post-launch to measure effectiveness:

- Which teams accessed assets the most?
- Which images were most viewed/downloaded?
- Did view spikes align with campaign milestones?
- Were there unused assets to improve next time?

## Troubleshooting Checklist

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| QR code not scanning | Low resolution | Download high-res version |
| Gallery expired early | Expiration misconfigured | Extend expiration date |
| Partners can’t download | Download disabled | Enable downloads per gallery |
| Unusual traffic detected | Link forwarded externally | Rotate link, enable password |

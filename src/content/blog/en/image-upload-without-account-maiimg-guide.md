## What You Can Do Without Registration

- Upload multiple images in one session.
- Generate a shareable link and QR code.
- Set view limits and expiry.
- Check open statistics from the result page.

## Fast Workflow

1. Upload selected files.
2. Set policy (views, expiry, duration if needed).
3. Generate link/QR.
4. Share with the target audience.

## When No-Account Upload Is a Good Fit

- Quick client previews.
- Event-day media sharing.
- One-off collaboration with external stakeholders.

## Risk Controls You Should Still Use

- Keep temporary content on short expiry.
- Reduce view limit for sensitive drafts.
- Avoid sharing one link across unrelated audiences.

## Bottom Line

No-account upload is efficient when combined with clear access rules and planned link lifecycle management.

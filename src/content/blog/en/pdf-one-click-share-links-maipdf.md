## What One-Click Sharing Should Include

- Fast link generation from uploaded PDF.
- Optional QR code for mobile distribution.
- Access policy (view limit, expiry, optional download restriction).
- Open statistics for follow-up timing.

## Standard Workflow

1. Upload one PDF for one audience objective.
2. Set policy before distribution.
3. Generate link and QR code.
4. Share by channel (email/chat/meeting).
5. Monitor opens and close link when no longer needed.

## Recommended Settings

| Scenario | View limit | Expiry | Download |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales proposal | Low-medium | 3-14 days | Usually off |
| Team briefing | Medium | 7-30 days | Optional |
| External handout | Medium-high | 14-90 days | Optional |

## Common Mistakes

- Sending link before policy is set.
- Reusing one link across unrelated audiences.
- Keeping temporary links alive after decision windows.

## Bottom Line

One-click sharing is effective only when speed is paired with clear access rules and link retirement discipline.

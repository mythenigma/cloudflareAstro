## When Offline Packages Are the Right Choice

- Field operations with unstable network.
- Training rooms with restricted connectivity.
- Controlled distribution requiring predictable open behavior.

## Packaging Workflow

1. Finalize the PDF version.
2. Generate offline HTML package.
3. Test package on target device types.
4. Distribute with clear recipient instructions.
5. Track package versions in a distribution log.

## Tradeoffs You Must Accept

- Stronger network independence.
- Less real-time control after distribution.
- Limited live open-statistics visibility compared to online mode.

## Best Practices

- Use explicit package version naming.
- Keep short validity windows for sensitive materials.
- Assign one owner for re-issue and support.

## Bottom Line

Offline packages are effective when managed like release artifacts, not ad-hoc file exports.

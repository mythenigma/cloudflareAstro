# Smart PDF Sharing with Access Logs: Know Who Viewed Your Files

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>You send a PDF. It gets opened.</p>
  <p>But who opened it? When? Where?</p>
  <p>If you're using traditional file-sharing methods—email attachments, cloud drives, or messaging apps—you'll never really know.</p>
  <p>That's where access logs for PDF sharing come in.</p>
</div>

## 🧠 Why Track PDF Access?

Not every document is meant to be shared and forgotten. Whether you're sending confidential reports, proposals, or internal materials, sometimes you need visibility, not just delivery.

With access logging, you can:

- ✅ Know exactly when your file was opened
- 🌍 See the viewer's IP or approximate location
- 🔁 Track repeated access by the same person or others
- 🛑 Disable the link if something feels suspicious

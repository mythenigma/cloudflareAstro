# Share PDF on WhatsApp with Links Instead of Files

WhatsApp is faster with links than file attachments, especially for large PDFs.

## WhatsApp sharing workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate link.
2. Set expiry/open-limit policy.
3. Paste link in WhatsApp message with short context.
4. Review open statistics and close stale links.

## Why links are better here

- Instant send in chat
- Better mobile viewing
- No large-file upload delays
- Easier policy control after sending

## Final takeaway

For WhatsApp distribution, link-first sharing is the practical default.

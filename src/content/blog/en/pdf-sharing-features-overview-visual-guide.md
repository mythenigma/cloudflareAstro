## What you’re looking at

- **Online sharing controls**: view limits, expiration, verification, and tracking
- **Offline option**: a self-contained package for environments without reliable internet
- **Security layer**: protections that keep distribution simple while reducing risk

## A simple way to choose

- Pick **online** when you need **real-time control** and **analytics**
- Pick **offline** when you need a **single file** that can be distributed without relying on a network

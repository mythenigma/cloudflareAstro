## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | Offline sharing | Online sharing |
|---|---|---|
| Connectivity dependency | Low | High |
| Real-time policy updates | Limited | Strong |
| Open statistics | Limited | Strong |
| Recipient setup effort | Medium | Low |
| Revocation speed | Slower | Faster |

## Choose Offline When

- Internet availability is uncertain.
- Distribution happens in controlled local environments.
- Stability matters more than live controls.

## Choose Online When

- You need link-level policy controls.
- You need open statistics for follow-up.
- You expect frequent updates or revocation needs.

## Hybrid Model (Recommended in Many Teams)

- Use online sharing by default.
- Keep offline packages for fallback or field scenarios.
- Align both with one version and distribution log.

## Bottom Line

Use online for control and adaptability. Use offline for network independence and predictable delivery in constrained environments.

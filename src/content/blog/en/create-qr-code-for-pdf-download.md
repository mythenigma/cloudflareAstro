# How to Create a QR Code for PDF Download

Use this when you need fast document delivery from posters, slides, booths, packaging inserts, or business cards.

## Quick Setup

![Upload Section](/maipdf-images/upload_section.png)

1. Finalize your PDF and keep filename clear (`Product-Catalog-Q2-2026.pdf`).
2. Upload it to an HTTPS location that recipients can access without login.
3. Copy a stable share link (or a direct-download link if your use case requires it).
4. Convert that link into a QR code.
5. Test on iOS and Android before printing.
6. Place the QR where users can scan comfortably (eye level, enough quiet space).

## Link Rules That Prevent Failure

- Use HTTPS links only.
- Avoid links that expire too early.
- Keep one canonical link per campaign.
- Re-test after any file update.

## Best-Fit Use Cases

- Event brochures and product sheets
- Menus, forms, and onboarding docs
- Portfolio/resume handouts
- Classroom and training materials

## Final Takeaway

The workflow is simple: upload PDF, create link, generate QR, test on mobile, then publish.  
If you need control later, use a link provider that supports expiry, download rules, and open stats.

# Safe Client Image Delivery Tool: Practical Guide

For client media delivery, control and clarity matter more than raw upload speed.

## Secure delivery baseline

- Use one gallery per client/project
- Set expiry by review window
- Disable download for sensitive previews
- Use optional password or verification for private deliveries

## Recommended presets

### Proofing stage

- Download: off
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Open limit: medium

### Final handoff

- Download: on
- Expiry: 30 days
- Open limit: high

## Workflow

1. Upload images in batch.
2. Apply client-specific policy.
3. Share link (and password separately if used).
4. Monitor open statistics and close when project ends.

## Final takeaway

Safe client delivery is a lifecycle process: controlled access during review, clean handoff at approval, and timely closure.

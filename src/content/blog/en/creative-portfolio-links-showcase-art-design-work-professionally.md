# Creative Portfolio Links for Art and Design

Creative work needs visual quality and controlled distribution. Portfolio links give both when configured with simple rules.

## Build a better creative portfolio page

- Lead with signature work
- Group projects by style or client type
- Keep text short and visual-first
- Optimize PDF export for mobile readability

## Sharing presets

### Gallery or recruiter submission

- Download: optional
- Expiry: 30 days
- Open limit: high

### Client proposal or paid pitch

- Download: off
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Open limit: medium
- Watermark: on

## Protecting creative assets

- Use separate links per client/agency
- Disable links after decision window closes
- Reissue links for revised versions only

## Common mistakes

- Sending giant portfolios with no focus
- Reusing one universal link for every opportunity
- Letting old versions remain active

## Final takeaway

The best creative portfolio links are focused and short-lived: high visual impact for intended viewers, low leakage risk afterward.

# Maiimg Event Photo Delivery: Practical Guide

Event photo delivery works best with fast access and controlled gallery lifecycles.

## Delivery workflow

1. Upload same-day selects.
2. Create audience-specific galleries.
3. Set expiry/download policy.
4. Generate QR + link for distribution.
5. Monitor open statistics and close stale galleries.

## Typical audience setup

- Attendees: medium controls, short-to-medium expiry
- Media/PR: controlled download policy
- Internal team: broader access for operations

## Final takeaway

Use one gallery strategy per audience group to balance speed and control during event delivery.

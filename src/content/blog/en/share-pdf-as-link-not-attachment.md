## Why Links Usually Win

- No mailbox size limits.
- One source of truth instead of many copies.
- Easier access policy control (expiry, view limits).
- Cleaner analytics through open statistics.

## Link-Sharing Workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate share link.
2. Configure policy before sending.
3. Share link/QR in the right channel.
4. Follow up by open activity and close stale links.

## When Attachments Still Make Sense

- Recipient environment blocks external links.
- Legal workflow requires immutable local copy exchange.
- Temporary emergency fallback.

## Practical Tips

- Keep one link per audience segment.
- Include expiry note in the message.
- Avoid mixing old and new links in one thread.

## Bottom Line

For most business distribution, link-first sharing is faster, clearer, and easier to control than attachments.

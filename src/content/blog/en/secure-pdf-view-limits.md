# Secure PDF Sharing: Control Access with View Limits

View limits are a fast, high-impact control for secure PDF sharing.

## Practical setup

- Low limit for confidential documents
- Medium limit for client review
- High limit for broad internal reference

## Add-on controls

- Expiry for time-bounded access
- Download restrictions for sensitive files
- Watermark for accountability

## Final takeaway

Use view limits as default and pair with expiry for predictable access control.

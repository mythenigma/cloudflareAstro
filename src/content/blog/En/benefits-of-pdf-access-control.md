![Security Settings](/maipdf-images/security%20setting.png)

MaiPDF offers powerful features to control how your PDF is accessed:

<div class="features-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>📊 Limit the number of opens</h3>
    <p>You can set how many times the file can be opened. Once the limit is reached, the link becomes inactive. This ensures your file won't be accessed more than intended.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>⏱️ Set reading time per open</h3>
    <p>You can define how long each viewer is allowed to view the PDF. This is especially useful for time-sensitive or confidential content.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>🔒 Disable downloading and copying</h3>
    <p>Prevent viewers from downloading the file or copying its content. This is ideal for protecting intellectual property, client reports, or internal documents.</p>
  </div>
</div>

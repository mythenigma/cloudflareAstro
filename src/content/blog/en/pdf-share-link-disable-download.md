# PDF Share Link Disable Download: View-Only Setup

View-only sharing is useful when recipients need to read but should not keep local copies.

## Setup workflow

1. Upload PDF and open settings.
2. Disable download.
3. Set expiry and open limits.
4. Share audience-specific link.

## Best scenarios

- Proposal review
- Internal sensitive documentation
- Time-limited draft circulation

## Final takeaway

Use view-only mode with lifecycle controls for better distribution discipline.

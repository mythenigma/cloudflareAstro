# How to Limit PDF Access Count: Practical Guide

Access count limits are a direct way to keep shared PDFs from being opened indefinitely.

## Policy templates

### Small external review

- Access count: low
- Expiry: 3-7 days
- Download: off

### Standard client circulation

- Access count: medium
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Download: optional

### Broad internal reference

- Access count: high
- Expiry: 30 days

## Operating workflow

1. Classify file sensitivity.
2. Apply count-limit preset.
3. Add expiry and watermark if needed.
4. Share segmented links.
5. Rotate link when scope changes.

## Final takeaway

Count limits alone are not enough. Combine them with expiry and audience segmentation for reliable control.

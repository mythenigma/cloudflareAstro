# Share Sales Pitch Decks with Controlled Access

For sales decks, control after sending is as important as content quality.

## Recommended sales deck policy

- Download: off
- Expiry: aligned to offer window
- Open limit: medium
- Watermark: on for pricing-sensitive proposals

## Workflow

1. Upload final pitch deck.
2. Apply sales preset policy.
3. Share with intended decision group only.
4. Review open statistics before follow-up.
5. Disable link after cycle ends.

## Final takeaway

Controlled deck sharing protects negotiation context and reduces uncontrolled forwarding risk.

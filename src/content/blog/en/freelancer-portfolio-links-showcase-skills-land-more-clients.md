# Freelancer Portfolio Links: Win More Clients with Clear Sharing

Freelancer portfolios fail when they are hard to open, too long, or outdated. A controlled link helps you ship the right version to the right client quickly.

## Client-facing workflow

1. Keep one short master portfolio PDF.
2. Duplicate by niche (branding, web, product, etc.).
3. Create separate links for each prospect segment.
4. Add expiry for active sales windows.

## What improves conversion

- Strong first 3 projects above the fold
- Short case captions with outcome metrics
- Mobile-friendly reading with no download barrier
- Clean link in proposals and outreach messages

## Settings template for freelancers

- Download: off for early-stage leads
- Open limit: medium
- Expiry: 7-21 days
- Watermark: on for high-value proposals

## Weekly maintenance routine

- Retire weak projects
- Replace outdated screenshots
- Refresh active links for current campaigns
- Review open statistics before follow-up

## Final takeaway

Freelance portfolio links are a sales asset. Keep them short, current, and audience-specific.

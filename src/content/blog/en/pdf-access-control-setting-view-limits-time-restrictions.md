# PDF Access Control: View Limits and Time Restrictions

Access control should be simple enough to apply every time you share a document.

## Two core controls

- View limit: cap how many opens are allowed
- Expiry: define exactly when access ends

## Recommended presets

### External proposal

- View limit: medium
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Download: off

### Internal reference

- View limit: high
- Expiry: 30 days
- Download: optional

### Confidential review

- View limit: low
- Expiry: 3-7 days
- Download: off
- Watermark: Visitor ID

## Operating workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Apply preset.
3. Generate link.
4. Share by audience segment.
5. Review open logs and rotate when needed.

## Final takeaway

View limits and expiry provide most of the control teams need. Apply them consistently and avoid one permanent link for all recipients.

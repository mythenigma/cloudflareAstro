## Portfolio Requirements Today

- Rapid turnaround for client previews
- Consistent branding across deliverables
- Control over screenshots and leaks
- Ability to update content instantly
- Analytics to see which pieces resonate

Maiimg addresses these needs with gallery-based sharing.

## Portfolio Types

| Portfolio Type | Use Case | Recommended Setup |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Pitch Deck Gallery | New client proposals | 10–15 flagship pieces, 7-day expiration |
| Case Study Gallery | Retainer updates | Unlimited views, downloads on |
| Event Recap Gallery | Live shot delivery | QR code distribution, 30-day expiration |
| Hiring Portfolio | Recruiting prospects | Public link, high view limit |

## Workflow Blueprint

### 1. Curate Assets

- Select 10–25 images per gallery
- Mix hero images, process shots, behind-the-scenes
- Export consistent aspect ratios for cohesion

### 2. Upload & Organize

- Drag-and-drop entire set (up to 25 images)
- Order images by narrative importance
- Use descriptive filenames (`Client_Project_Year_View`)

### 3. Configure Access

- **Client Preview**: View limit 10, expiration 14 days, downloads off
- **Public Portfolio**: View limit 200, no expiration, downloads optional
- **Agency Collaboration**: Password required, downloads on, expiration 30 days

### 4. Brand the Delivery

- Add cover image (first slot) with logo + project title
- Customize intro text in email template
- Attach QR code to presentation boards or printed leave-behinds

### 5. Deliver & Monitor

- Send unique link per client
- Embed QR code in PDF portfolios
- Track view counts to gauge engagement
- Update gallery to add/remove shots instantly

## Email Template

```
Subject: Portfolio Preview – [Project Name]

Hi [Client],

Here is the curated preview of our recent work together. The gallery includes hero shots, detail crops, and lifestyle context.

Access link: https://maiimg.com/...
Expires on: Dec 12, 2025
Downloads: Disabled to keep things polished (just let me know if you need originals)

Let me know which shots resonate most—we can adjust the selection before final delivery.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

## Advanced Tips

### Client-Specific Galleries

- Duplicate galleries per stakeholder (marketing vs. product teams)
- Tailor copy and ordering for each audience
- Use analytics to see which version gets more traction

### Version Control

- Keep a "Live" gallery link for recurring work
- Update images without changing the URL
- Note updates in the description (e.g., “Added Concept C on Nov 29”)

### Offline Presentations

- Include QR codes in printed pitch books
- Use tablets with preloaded galleries during meetings
- Provide NFC cards linked to Maiimg galleries for premium touch

### Protecting Unreleased Work

- Enable short expiration windows
- Require password access for NDA content
- Disable downloads and limit views to 5
- Delete gallery immediately after presentation

## Analytics Insights

Track which pieces resonate:

- View ranking per image
- Time spent per gallery
- Geographic access (global clients)
- Peak viewing periods (before/after meetings)
- Repeat visits indicating strong interest

Use insights to tailor follow-up pitches.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Colors look off | Images auto-converted | Export sRGB JPEGs for consistency |
| Client can’t access | Link expired | Extend expiration or reissue link |
| Need more than 25 shots | Gallery limit | Break into chapters (Part 1, Part 2) |
| Downloads disabled by mistake | Setting misconfigured | Enable "Allow downloads" and resend |

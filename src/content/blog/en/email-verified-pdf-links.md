# Email-Verified PDF Links: Stop Forwarded Access

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>If a PDF link gets forwarded, you lose control. Email verification keeps access tied to a person, not a URL.</p>
</div>

## How it works (in plain terms)

- Share a link
- The viewer enters an email
- A code is sent
- Only verified viewers can open the PDF

## When to use it

- Proposals & quotes
- HR documents
- Client deliverables

## When Offline Packaging Makes Sense

- Restricted or unreliable network environments.
- Controlled environments for training or field ops.
- Distribution scenarios where online dependency is risky.

## Package Creation Workflow

1. Prepare the final PDF version.
2. Generate the offline package.
3. Test open behavior on target device types.
4. Distribute package through approved channels.
5. Keep version and expiration notes in distribution log.

## What Offline Mode Gives You

- Local availability without internet.
- Stable recipient experience in low-connectivity regions.
- Predictable distribution unit (single package).

## What Offline Mode Does Not Give You

- Real-time open statistics.
- Dynamic server-side policy updates after distribution.
- Immediate remote revocation in all cases.

## Operational Best Practices

- Use short distribution windows for sensitive content.
- Version packages clearly (`DocName_vDate`).
- Keep a recipient map for controlled updates.

## Bottom Line

Offline packages work best as planned distribution artifacts, not ad-hoc file dumps.

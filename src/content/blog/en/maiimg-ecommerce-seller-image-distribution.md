# Maiimg for E-commerce Sellers: Image Distribution System

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Sellers juggling Amazon, Shopify, wholesale and affiliate channels need a reliable image distribution workflow. <strong>Maiimg</strong> gives brands a reseller hub with role-based galleries, download permissions, QR inserts, and analytics to audit every marketplace partner.</p>
</div>

## Channel Challenges

- Amazon wants cropped hero shots while Shopify needs lifestyle content
- Resellers keep outdated price tags in their creative
- Affiliate partners lose links in giant ZIP files
- Operations teams lack visibility into which partners actually pulled assets

## Gallery Blueprint

| Channel | Asset Types | Settings |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Amazon/Marketplace | White background packshots, compliance icons | View 150, download ON, expire 30 days |
| Shopify/DTC | Lifestyle, banner modules, GIFs | View 120, download ON, expire 21 days |
| Wholesale/Distributor | Catalog spreads, printable POS | View 200, download ON, expire 45 days |
| Affiliate/UGC | Cropped squares, story frames | View 300, download OFF, expire 14 days |

## Implementation Steps

1. Export channel-specific assets (WebP for web, PNG for high-res)
2. Upload 20–25 images per gallery with descriptive filenames (`SKU_Channel_Variant`)
3. Configure view limits, expiration, downloads, and optional passwords
4. Generate link + QR code and store in your partner portal or onboarding doc
5. Embed QR codes on packaging inserts for smaller resellers

## Partner Onboarding Template

```
Welcome to the [Brand] Asset Hub 🚀
Marketplace gallery: https://maiimg.com/...
Wholesale gallery: https://maiimg.com/... (downloads enabled)
QR cards attached for your store staff.
Assets refresh on the first business day each month. Please bookmark the links and retire older files.
```

## Packaging Insert Example

```
Need updated photos?
Scan this code to access the official asset library.
Last refreshed: Nov 29, 2025
```

## Analytics Use Cases

- Flag resellers who never accessed the gallery → follow up
- Identify which packshots drive the most downloads → optimize PDP
- Track geographies accessing the link → detect unauthorized regions
- Compare view counts pre/post launch to measure enablement

## Automation Tips

- Sync Maiimg links in Airtable/Notion reseller records
- Use Zapier to notify channel managers when view limits near capacity
- Rotate QR codes quarterly to prevent stale assets in circulation
- Clone previous galleries to roll forward seasonal campaigns

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Seller shares link publicly | Enable password + reduce view limit |
| 25 image cap hit | Split by product line or season |
| Slow loading for overseas partners | Provide compressed WebP gallery |
| Partner loses access | Extend expiration and email refreshed link |

## Results

E-commerce teams using Maiimg eliminate asset confusion, speed up reseller onboarding, and prove partner enablement with real data. Centralize once—distribute everywhere.

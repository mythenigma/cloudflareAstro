# Maiimg for Creative Portfolios: Sharing Workflow

Creative portfolio delivery should be visual-first and policy-driven.

## Workflow

1. Curate a focused image set per client/use case.
2. Upload as one gallery.
3. Apply expiry and download policy.
4. Share link/QR.
5. Refresh gallery as portfolio evolves.

## Practical rules

- Separate galleries by audience
- Keep each gallery short and high-signal
- Retire old links after decision window

## Final takeaway

Portfolio workflows improve when galleries are audience-specific and lifecycle-managed.

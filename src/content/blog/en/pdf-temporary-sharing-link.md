# PDF Temporary Sharing Link Tool

In daily work and study, we often need to share PDF files with others. Traditional file sharing methods often have problems: email attachments have size limits, cloud storage sharing requires account registration, and social software transmission compresses quality. This PDF temporary sharing tool provides a more flexible and secure solution.

Its core function is to generate temporary sharing links with access control for uploaded PDF files, allowing users to precisely control the sharing scope and access permissions of files.

## Why Choose Temporary Sharing?

Traditional file sharing methods are often "share once, permanently valid," which is not appropriate in certain scenarios. For example:

- **Business Documents**: Only want clients to view a specific number of times, avoid documents being spread unlimitedly
- **Learning Materials**: Teachers share course materials with students, want to control download permissions
- **Temporary Collaboration**: Project documents need to be viewed by multiple people in the short term, but don't want to be stored online long-term
- **Sensitive Information**: Documents containing personal information need strict access control

This tool is designed to solve these practical needs.

## Detailed Feature Introduction

### File Upload and Link Generation

The entire upload process is very simple and direct. Users only need to select the local PDF file, and the system will immediately start uploading and processing.

During the upload process, the system will display upload progress, letting users know the current status. After the file upload is complete, the system will automatically generate a unique sharing link.

This link is specifically generated for this PDF file and contains a random identifier, ensuring the uniqueness and security of the link.

### Precise Access Count Control

Access count control is one of the core functions of this tool. Users can set the access count of the link according to actual needs:

- **Single Access**: Suitable for sending to a specific person to view
- **Multiple Access**: Can be set to 3, 5, 10 times, etc., suitable for small team internal sharing
- **More Access**: For documents that need more people to access, can set higher values

Once the access count reaches the set value, the link will immediately become invalid, and no one can access the file through this link anymore. This mechanism ensures the controllability of file sharing.

### Flexible Download Permission Management

Different sharing scenarios have different requirements for download permissions:

**Allow Download Mode:**
- Visitors can view PDF content online
- Can download files to local storage
- Suitable for scenarios that need offline viewing or printing

**View-Only Mode:**
- Visitors can only view in browser online
- Cannot download files to local
- Better protection against random distribution of documents

This permission control allows users to choose the appropriate access method based on the sensitivity of the document and sharing purpose.

## Conclusion

The PDF temporary sharing link tool provides a simple, secure, and controllable solution for document sharing. Through precise access control and flexible permission settings, users can share documents securely while maintaining control.

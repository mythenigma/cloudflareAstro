## 🌟 Why Maiimg? {#why-maiimg}

![Share Images Worldwide](/maiimg/maiimg-head.png)

Traditional image hosting platforms often lack fine-grained control. Once your images are shared, you lose track of how they are used or accessed. Maiimg changes that by combining ease of sharing with advanced analytics and tracking tools.

<div class="use-cases-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h4>🏢 Business Owners</h4>
    <p>Distribute product previews with controlled access</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h4>👨‍🏫 Teachers</h4>
    <p>Share classroom materials securely</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h4>🎨 Creative Professionals</h4>
    <p>Showcase your work with protection</p>
  </div>
</div>

Whether you're sharing professional content or personal memories, Maiimg ensures your images stay secure while remaining accessible.

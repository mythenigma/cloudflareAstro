# PDF Analytics: Practical Engagement Insights for Teams

Document analytics are useful when tied to concrete decisions, not dashboard vanity.

## Metrics that matter

- Open count and trend
- First-open timing
- Re-open behavior by segment
- Expired/blocked open attempts

## How teams use it

- Sales: follow-up timing on proposals
- Ops: detect abnormal access patterns
- Marketing: compare asset engagement by campaign

## Final takeaway

Use open statistics to drive action cadence, not just reporting.

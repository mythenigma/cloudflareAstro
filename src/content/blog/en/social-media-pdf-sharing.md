# Social Media PDF Sharing: Professional Link Workflow

Social platforms are link-first channels. PDF links work better than raw files for reach and consistency.

## Cross-platform workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate link.
2. Create short channel-specific copy.
3. Publish on social channels.
4. Monitor open statistics by campaign window.
5. Rotate link when content updates.

## Platform tips

- Instagram/TikTok: use bio link strategy
- LinkedIn/X/Facebook: post with clear CTA
- Private DM: send controlled link, not attachments

## Final takeaway

Treat social PDF sharing as campaign operations: one source link, multi-channel copy, timed lifecycle.

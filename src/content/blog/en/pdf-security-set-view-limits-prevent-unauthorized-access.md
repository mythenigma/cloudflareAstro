# PDF Security: Set View Limits to Prevent Unauthorized Access

View limits are one of the fastest ways to reduce uncontrolled access after sharing.

## Recommended secure baseline

- View limit: set based on recipient count
- Expiry: always set for non-permanent docs
- Download: off for sensitive materials
- Watermark: Visitor ID for critical files

## Scenario templates

### Sales/partner proposal

- View limit: medium
- Expiry: 7-14 days

### Internal controlled circulation

- View limit: high
- Expiry: 30 days

### Confidential or legal review

- View limit: low
- Expiry: 3-7 days
- Download: off

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Apply preset.
3. Share per audience segment.
4. Check open logs.
5. Revoke and reissue on abnormal activity.

## Final takeaway

Security control should be template-driven. Teams follow simple presets more reliably than custom settings every time.

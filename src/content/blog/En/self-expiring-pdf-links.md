A self-expiring link is a temporary URL that becomes unusable after a certain condition is met, such as:

- A specific date or time
- A set number of clicks or opens
- One-time use (expires after first access)

These links are commonly used to share sensitive documentsâ€”like contracts, reports, or private contentâ€”without risking them being passed around or saved indefinitely.

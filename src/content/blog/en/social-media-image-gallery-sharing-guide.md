# Social Media Image Gallery Sharing Guide

For campaign assets, one gallery link is cleaner than posting raw files repeatedly across platforms.

## Cross-platform workflow

1. Upload campaign images in one batch.
2. Generate gallery link (and optional QR).
3. Publish same link on each platform.
4. Track open statistics by campaign window.
5. Disable or rotate links when campaign ends.

## Platform usage pattern

- Instagram/TikTok: bio/profile link
- Facebook/LinkedIn/X: post link with short CTA
- Email/newsletter: embed link with thumbnail preview

## Quality checklist

- Verify mobile loading speed
- Confirm image order and cover image
- Keep copy short with clear action text
- Separate links by campaign or region

## Final takeaway

Gallery links improve consistency across platforms and simplify asset operations. Keep each link tied to a clear campaign lifecycle.

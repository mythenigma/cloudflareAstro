# Secure Architectural Plans: Protecting Designs and Blueprints

Architecture files are high-risk assets. Sharing should be phase-based, audience-based, and time-bounded.

## Control model for architectural docs

- Separate links by stakeholder type (client, contractor, consultant)
- Keep latest-version link only; retire outdated revisions
- Disable download for early-stage or bid-sensitive plans
- Use expiry windows tied to project phases

## Recommended project presets

### Concept review

- Download: off
- Expiry: short
- Open limit: medium

### Construction coordination

- Download: optional
- Expiry: phase-based
- Open limit: high

### Tender/confidential submissions

- Download: off
- Expiry: strict
- Watermark: Visitor ID

## Final takeaway

Blueprint security is mostly workflow discipline: right audience, right version, right time window.

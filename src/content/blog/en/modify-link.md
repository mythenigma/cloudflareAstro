# Modify Link: Maintain Flexibility of Shared PDFs

When sharing PDF files, you may encounter situations where you need to modify the link, such as updating file content or adjusting access permissions. MaiPDF provides a simple solution that allows you to complete these operations without regenerating new links.

## Why Modify Links?

The need to modify links may come from the following scenarios:

- **File Content Updates**: Need to replace old files, ensuring recipients access the latest version.
- **Permission Adjustments**: Change file access count, time limits, or other security settings.
- **Error Corrections**: Fix errors in links, avoid sending invalid links.

## How to Modify Links

Modifying links through MaiPDF is very simple, just follow these steps:

1. **Access Modify Link Page**
   - Open [https://maipdf.com/pdf/hahachange.php](https://maipdf.com/pdf/hahachange.php).

2. **Enter Original File Information**
   - **Reading Code**: This is the unique code in the link that identifies the file, for example `a67fc93884ad24` in `/file/a67fc93884ad24@pdf`.
   - **Control Code**: The key paired with the original file, used to verify your management permissions.

3. **Enter New File Information**
   - **New Reading Code**: The unique code of the new file.
   - **New Control Code**: The key paired with the new file.

4. **Click "Update File"**
   - After completing the operation, the original link will point to the new file, and all access settings remain unchanged.

## Advantages of Modifying Links

- **Keep Link Unchanged**: No need to resend links, saving time and effort.
- **Flexible Management**: Update file content or permission settings anytime.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Only users with control codes can modify links.

## Notes

- **Save Control Code**: The control code is key to modifying links, please keep it safe.
- **Regular Checks**: Ensure links point to correct files, avoid misoperations.

Through MaiPDF, you can easily manage shared PDF links, ensuring files always meet your needs.

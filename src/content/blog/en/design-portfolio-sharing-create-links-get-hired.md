# Design Portfolio Sharing: Create Links That Help You Get Hired

Hiring teams spend seconds on first review. Your link must open fast, show strongest work first, and avoid outdated versions.

## Portfolio build pattern

1. Keep one concise portfolio PDF (quality over quantity).
2. Put best 3 projects first.
3. Add short result-oriented captions.
4. Generate role-specific links (product, brand, UI, etc.).

## Sharing settings for hiring

- Download: optional for recruiter rounds
- Expiry: 14-30 days
- Open limit: medium/high
- Watermark: on for paid/client-facing concept work

## Follow-up workflow

- Share link in application and outreach mail
- Check open statistics before follow-up timing
- Refresh link when portfolio updates
- Disable stale links from old application cycles

## Common mistakes

- One generic portfolio for every role
- Too many similar projects
- Long text blocks instead of visual evidence

## Final takeaway

A hiring-ready design portfolio link is short, focused, and role-specific. Clarity beats volume.

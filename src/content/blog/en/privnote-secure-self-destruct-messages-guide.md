# Privnote Secure Self-Destruct Messages: Practical Guide

Self-destruct notes are useful for temporary sensitive information, not for long-term document governance.

## Best use cases

- One-time credential sharing
- Temporary operation notes
- Short-lived private instructions

## Safe sending workflow

1. Keep message scope minimal.
2. Enable one-time read if available.
3. Set short expiry.
4. Share note link and identity confirmation in separate channels.

## Avoid for

- Legal or contractual records
- Compliance-required communications
- High-value secrets needing full audit history

## Final takeaway

Use self-destruct notes for short context transfer only. For managed documents, use controlled link platforms.

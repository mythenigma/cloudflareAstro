# ‚è±Ô∏è Send Client Proposals That Expire After Viewing

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>You spend hours polishing a client proposal. It's tailored, strategic, and full of value.</p>
  <p>Then you send it as a PDF attachment and‚Ä¶ that's it. It's out there. Forever.</p>
  <p>What happens next? Did they open it? Did they forward it? Is it already outdated?</p>
  <p>That's where controlled proposal sharing comes in.</p>
</div>

## üì¶ The Problem with Traditional Proposal Sharing

Most proposals are sent via email attachments or cloud storage links (like Google Drive or Dropbox). That works‚Äîtechnically. But:

- üì• Clients can download and save the file forever
- üîÅ They can forward it without your knowledge
- üïµÔ∏è You don't know if or when it's been viewed
- üíº And once it's outdated, there's no way to take it back

For high-value projects, that lack of control isn't just inconvenient‚Äîit's risky.

## üîê The Solution: Send a Proposal That Expires After Viewing

Instead of sending a static file, you can now share your proposal via a secure, temporary link that:

- Can be viewed only once (or twice‚Äîyour call)
- Blocks downloading or copying
- Logs when and where it's accessed
- Can be updated or disabled at any time

The result? A smarter, cleaner way to share proposals that gives you back control‚Äîwithout sacrificing professionalism.

## üëÄ Use Case: A Better Client Experience

Imagine this:

You're a freelance consultant submitting a proposal to a new client. Instead of attaching a PDF, you send a clean link that opens directly in the browser. No logins, no friction. Just the proposal.

And behind the scenes:

- You've set it to expire after 2 views
- You'll get notified once it's opened
- You've disabled downloading, so they can't just save it or forward it
- You can revoke or update the file with one click if terms change

It's seamless for them, and strategic for you.

## üõ† How This Works (with Tools Like MaiPDF)

Modern lightweight platforms like MaiPDF offer this kind of link-based sharing. Here's what they typically provide:

1. Upload your proposal PDF
2. Generate a secure read-only link
3. Set a view count limit (e.g., max 2 opens)
4. Disable download or printing
5. Track IP address and view timestamps
6. Manage access using a separate edit code

The viewer just clicks the link and views. That's it. You stay in control from start to finish.

## üíº Who Needs This?

This approach is perfect for:

- **Freelancers & consultants**
- **Agencies bidding on RFPs**
- **Sales teams** sending estimates or pitch decks
- **Legal and financial services** sharing sensitive terms

In short: anyone who wants to send a proposal without losing control of it.

## ‚úÖ Final Thought

Sending a proposal shouldn't feel like handing over the keys.

With view-limited, browser-based sharing, you can:

- Know when your proposal is opened
- Control how long it's accessible
- Prevent forwarding or downloads
- Keep documents dynamic, not frozen

It's not just about protecting your content‚Äîit's about presenting yourself as the pro that you are.

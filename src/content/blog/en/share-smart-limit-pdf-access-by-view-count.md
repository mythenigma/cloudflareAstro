# Send PDF with No Email: QR and View Count Control

In live contexts, QR + controlled links are faster than email collection.

## Live sharing workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Generate QR + share link.
3. Set view-count limit and expiry.
4. Display QR in room or on screen.
5. Disable link after session.

## Best scenarios

- Workshops and classrooms
- Conferences and webinars
- Internal briefings with temporary access needs

## Final takeaway

Use QR for instant access and view limits for post-session control.

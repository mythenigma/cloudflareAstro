# Prevent PDF Downloads: Complete Guide to View-Only Document Sharing

<div class="intro-panel">
  You've created valuable content. You've spent hours perfecting your PDF. But once someone downloads it, you lose all control. <strong>View-only PDF sharing</strong> changes everything—keeping your documents secure while still allowing access to the information your audience needs.

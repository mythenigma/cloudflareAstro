# Maiimg for Architecture and Interior Design Portfolios

Architecture and interior teams need two things: visual quality and client-facing control. Gallery links work better than sending large image files repeatedly.

## Practical use cases

- Concept options for client selection
- Before/after renovation showcases
- Progress updates for active projects
- Portfolio links for new business pitches

## Recommended setup

### Client progress review

- Expiry: 14-30 days
- Download: optional
- Access: shared with project stakeholders only

### Pitch or tender submission

- Expiry: submission window
- Download: off
- Watermark: on for unreleased work

### Public portfolio sample

- Expiry: optional
- Download: on
- Separate from confidential project galleries

## Delivery checklist

- Keep one gallery per project phase
- Use clear image ordering (overview to detail)
- Add short captions for material/layout decisions
- Retire old galleries after handover

## Final takeaway

For design teams, image sharing should look polished and stay manageable. Separate public showcase from private review links and keep gallery lifecycles short.

4. Check watermark appearance
5. Verify view limits work
6. Test expiration dates

### Tip 3: Communicate Security Measures

**Inform recipients:**
- Why security is in place
- What restrictions apply
- How to access the document
- What to expect

**Example:**
> "I'm sharing a confidential document. The link requires email verification, allows 3 views, and expires in 7 days. Downloads are disabled for security."

### Tip 4: Regular Security Audits

**Monthly Review:**
- Access logs
- Security events

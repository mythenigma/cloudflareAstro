Dynamic Watermarks on PDF – Trace Every Access with MaiPDF
MaiPDF helps you protect your PDF content by generating a unique digital watermark for each viewing session. This empowers you to trace how your documents are being used—without disrupting the reader’s experience.

🧠 What Are Dynamic Watermarks?
When a PDF is opened via a MaiPDF link with watermarking enabled, the system adds a unique 8 or 9-digit ID visibly onto the page. This ID serves as a session fingerprint.

🔍 What You Can Track:
🖥️ Device details used to open the file

🌐 IP address at the time of access

🔗 The PDF’s viewing link

📧 If accessed via verification code, the email prefix of the recipient

This allows you to trace back the source of any unauthorized distribution or suspicious activity.

🔄 Watermarks Can Be Removed by Updating the File
If you want to remove the watermark later, simply use MaiPDF’s document replacement tool to update the file while keeping the same viewing link—perfect for flexible content control.

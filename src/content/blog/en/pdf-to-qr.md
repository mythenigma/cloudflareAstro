# Turn any PDF into a QR code

<div class="intro-panel">

  <p>Upload your PDF, receive a QR code, and let recipients access your document by scanning with any smartphone camera.</p>
</div>

## How PDF-to-QR works

The process converts any PDF document into a scannable QR code in seconds:

### 1. Upload your PDF
Select your document using the file browser or drag and drop it onto the upload area. The system accepts standard PDF files without size restrictions for most documents.

### 2. Generate the QR code
Once uploaded, the system automatically creates a unique QR code linked to your PDF. This code contains a secure URL that directs scanners to your document.

### 3. Configure access settings
Choose your sharing preferences:
- Set how many times the QR code can be scanned
- Enable or disable PDF downloads
- Set expiration timeframes
- Add viewing time limits per session

### 4. Share the QR code
Use the generated QR code in multiple ways:
- Print it on business cards or flyers
- Include it in presentations or reports
- Share it via messaging apps
- Embed it in websites or emails

</div>

## Practical applications

### Business cards and marketing
Print QR codes on business cards to share portfolios, brochures, or product catalogs. Recipients scan the code and view your materials immediately without typing URLs or downloading apps.

### Event materials
Include QR codes in conference programs, workshop handouts, or meeting agendas. Attendees can quickly access detailed information, schedules, or supplementary documents.

### Educational distribution
Teachers can print QR codes on assignments or course materials, allowing students to access resources using their phones. This eliminates the need for complex file sharing systems or email distribution lists.

### Restaurant menus and information
Restaurants and businesses can display QR codes for menus, special offers, or detailed product information. Customers scan to view current offerings without handling physical materials.

### Real estate and property
Real estate agents can place QR codes on property signs, leading to detailed listings, floor plans, or virtual tours. Interested buyers get immediate access to comprehensive information.

## Access control features

### Scan limits
Set a maximum number of times your QR code can be used. Once this limit is reached, the code becomes inactive, preventing unlimited sharing beyond your intended audience.

### Download restrictions
Choose whether users can download the PDF file or restrict access to view-only mode. This protects your content while still making it accessible.

### Time-based controls
Set expiration dates for automatic QR code deactivation. Most codes expire within 24 hours by default, ensuring temporary access for time-sensitive materials.

### Session duration
Control how long each viewing session lasts. After the specified time, users need to scan the QR code again to continue viewing.

</div>

## Technical advantages

### Universal compatibility
QR codes work with any smartphone camera app or QR code scanner. Recipients don't need specific software or apps to access your PDF documents.

### Offline sharing
Once generated, QR codes can be printed and shared without internet connectivity. The code itself contains all necessary information to access your document when scanned.

### Cross-platform access
Documents opened through QR codes work on all devices: iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux. Browser-based viewing ensures consistent access across platforms.

### No typing required
QR codes eliminate the need to manually enter URLs or search for files. A simple scan provides immediate access to your document.

## Security considerations

### Link-based access
QR codes contain URLs that link to your PDF. Anyone with the QR code can access the document within your set parameters.

### Temporary storage
Documents are hosted temporarily on secure servers. Most links expire automatically, ensuring your files don't remain accessible indefinitely.

### View tracking
Monitor when and how many times your QR code has been scanned. This visibility helps you understand document engagement and usage patterns.

### No account requirements
Recipients don't need to create accounts or provide personal information to access documents through QR codes.

## Comparison with alternatives

**Email attachments**: Limited by file size restrictions and recipient email systems. QR codes work regardless of email capabilities.

**File sharing platforms**: Often require account creation and complex sharing settings. QR codes provide immediate access without registration.

**Physical document distribution**: Eliminates printing costs and ensures recipients always access the most current version.

**URL sharing**: QR codes eliminate typing errors and provide instant access through smartphone cameras.

## When to use PDF-to-QR

**Best for:**
- Physical distribution (business cards, flyers, signs)
- Mobile-first sharing situations
- Events and presentations
- Print materials with digital supplements
- Situations where typing URLs is impractical

**Consider alternatives for:**
- Email-based workflows
- Desktop-focused document sharing
- Long-term document storage needs
- Complex collaboration requirements

# PDF Online Viewer Prevent Copy: Practical Protection Guide

Copy prevention features reduce casual misuse, but should be combined with lifecycle and access controls.

## Recommended control stack

- View-only online delivery
- Copy restrictions in viewer
- Download/print off for sensitive docs
- Expiry + open limits
- Watermark for accountability

## Use cases

- Paid reports and premium content
- Proposal and pricing documents
- Internal policy or strategy files
- Pre-release design drafts

## Final takeaway

Prevent-copy settings are useful, but strongest when paired with short-lived controlled links and fast revoke actions.

## The Evolution of PDF Sharing

Traditional methods of sharing PDFs come with significant limitations:

| Method | Limitations | Security Concerns |
| :----- | :---------- | :---------------- |
| Email attachments | Size limits (typically 10-25MB) | No access control after sending |
| Physical drives | Requires in-person exchange | Devices can be lost or stolen |
| File transfer services | Files expire quickly | Limited tracking capabilities |
| General cloud storage | Complex permission setup | No view limits or monitoring |

Today's digital collaboration demands more sophisticated options for sharing documents—particularly when those documents contain sensitive or valuable information.

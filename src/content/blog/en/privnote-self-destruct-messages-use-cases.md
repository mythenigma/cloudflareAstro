# Privnote Self-Destruct Messages: Practical Use Cases

Self-destruct notes are useful for temporary information exchange, but they are not a full substitute for enterprise document controls.

## Good use cases

- One-time credential handoff
- Temporary verification instructions
- Short-lived coordination notes
- Quick privacy-sensitive reminders

## Not ideal for

- Long-term audit-required communications
- Contract or policy records
- Regulated documentation workflows

## Safe usage checklist

- Keep message scope minimal
- Add short expiry and one-time read policy
- Avoid sending high-value secrets in one note
- Use separate channel for identity confirmation

## Final takeaway

Self-destruct notes are best for short-lived context, not primary document governance.

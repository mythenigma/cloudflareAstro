# Streamlined Document Sharing: Secure Upload Process

Upload is the first control point in secure sharing workflows.

## Upload checklist

- Confirm file is final version
- Classify sensitivity level
- Apply access template before sharing
- Verify expiry/open-limit settings

## Post-upload workflow

1. Generate controlled link.
2. Test link on mobile and desktop.
3. Distribute to segmented audience.
4. Monitor open logs.

## Final takeaway

A standardized upload checklist prevents most sharing errors before they happen.

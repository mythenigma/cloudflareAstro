# Secure Document Distribution: Practical Strategies

Distribution security is a process decision before it is a tool decision.

## Strategy baseline

- Segment recipients by role
- Use separate links by audience
- Apply expiry and open limits by sensitivity
- Use controlled channels (email/chat/portal) by policy

## Operational steps

1. Classify document sensitivity.
2. Choose delivery channel.
3. Apply policy template.
4. Share and monitor open logs.
5. Revoke or rotate links as needed.

## Final takeaway

Secure distribution succeeds when sharing policy is standardized across teams.

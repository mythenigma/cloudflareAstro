# Maiimg for Product Launches: Image Distribution Playbook

Product launches need one source of visual truth with controlled access for each stakeholder group.

## Launch workflow

1. Organize assets by campaign and audience.
2. Batch upload and create gallery links.
3. Apply expiry and access policy by partner type.
4. Distribute links/QR codes to channels.
5. Monitor open statistics and retire stale galleries.

## Audience segmentation

- Marketing and PR: campaign-ready assets
- Sales: deal-support visual packs
- Channel partners: localized or retail-ready sets

## Final takeaway

Launch speed improves when distribution is centralized and policy-driven.

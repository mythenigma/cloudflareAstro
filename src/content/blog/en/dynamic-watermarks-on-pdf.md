# Dynamic Watermarks on PDF: Practical Security & Leak Deterrence

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Dynamic watermarks add recipient-specific context during viewing to increase accountability and discourage careless forwarding.</p>
</div>

## What Dynamic Watermarks Are

- Viewer-time overlays applied at document open.
- Context markers for accountability (time/session context).
- A deterrence layer, not absolute anti-capture protection.

## Setup Workflow

1. Enable dynamic watermark in sharing settings.
2. Define watermark format and visibility level.
3. Publish controlled link with expiry/view limits.
4. Review open statistics during distribution window.

## How to Use in Real Operations

- Sales and proposal sharing.
- Internal policy or pricing previews.
- Partner materials with short validity windows.

## Limits You Should Communicate

- Watermarks discourage leakage but do not block screenshots.
- They work best with policy controls (expiry + view limits).
- They are strongest as part of a full sharing process.

## Incident Response Baseline

- Save leaked evidence immediately.
- Match with relevant open-statistics timeframe.
- Revoke active links and rotate distribution set.

## Bottom Line

Dynamic watermarking is most valuable as a practical accountability layer within controlled sharing workflows.

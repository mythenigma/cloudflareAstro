# Smart PDF Sharing Experience: Complete File Transfer in Three Simple Steps

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Smart sharing means reducing delivery friction while keeping policy control and lifecycle ownership.</p>
</div>

## Three-Step Model

1. Upload one document for one audience purpose.
2. Configure policy (view limits, expiry, optional download restriction).
3. Share link/QR and manage lifecycle using open statistics.

## Why This Model Works

- Faster than attachment-driven workflows.
- Clear access boundaries before distribution.
- Better follow-up timing based on real opens.
- Easier revocation when document context changes.

## Practical Use Cases

| Use case | What to optimize |
|---|---|
| Sales deck delivery | Short expiry + medium view limit |
| Contract review | Low view limit + tighter expiry |
| Internal updates | Stable link + controlled timeline |

## Common Failure Patterns

- Delayed policy setup.
- Link reuse across unrelated recipients.
- No ownership for link retirement.

## Bottom Line

Smart PDF sharing is a repeatable workflow, not a feature toggle.

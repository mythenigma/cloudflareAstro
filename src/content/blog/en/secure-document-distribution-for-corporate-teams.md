# Secure Document Distribution for Corporate Teams

Corporate sharing needs governance after sending, not just secure upload.

## Team distribution baseline

- Segment links by department or role
- Set expiry for sensitive updates
- Use view limits for high-risk files
- Revoke links immediately when scope changes

## Common corporate scenarios

- Strategy and finance decks
- HR policy updates
- Product and roadmap docs

## Final takeaway

Secure internal distribution is a repeatable policy workflow, not a one-time file transfer.

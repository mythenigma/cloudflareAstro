# Free Image Storage: Practical Online Hosting Guide

Free image storage should still be operationally clean: organized galleries, predictable links, and clear expiration rules.

## Practical storage model

- Use one gallery per project/campaign
- Split permanent assets and temporary assets
- Set expiry for short-term shares
- Keep naming conventions for easier retrieval

## Recommended use cases

- Campaign and social media assets
- Event photo delivery
- Product image handoff
- Portfolio previews

## Sharing checklist

- Verify mobile loading speed
- Confirm image order before sending
- Test link in incognito mode
- Add expiry notice in message copy

## Final takeaway

Free hosting works best with structure. Treat galleries as managed assets, not ad hoc uploads.

# Transform PDFs into Shareable Links in 3 Steps

## 3-step workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Generate share link.
3. Set policy and distribute.

## Recommended default settings

- Expiry for temporary sharing
- Open limits by audience size
- Download off for sensitive docs

## Final takeaway

Three steps are enough when policy defaults are applied before sharing.

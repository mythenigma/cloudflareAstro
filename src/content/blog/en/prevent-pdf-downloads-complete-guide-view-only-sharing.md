## What View-Only Controls Can Do

- Remove easy download path.
- Limit access window by expiry.
- Restrict open count with view limits.
- Add accountability with open statistics.

## What It Cannot Fully Prevent

- Screenshots and external camera capture.
- Manual content re-creation.
- Sharing through out-of-band channels.

## Setup Workflow

1. Upload PDF and enable view-only sharing policy.
2. Set expiry and view limits.
3. Share by link/QR.
4. Monitor open statistics and revoke when needed.

## Policy Baseline

| Sensitivity | View limit | Expiry |
|---|---|---|
| Low | Medium-high | 30-90 days |
| Medium | Medium | 7-30 days |
| High | Low | 1-7 days |

## Bottom Line

Preventing downloads is a risk-reduction control, not absolute DRM. It works best with short access windows and audience-specific links.

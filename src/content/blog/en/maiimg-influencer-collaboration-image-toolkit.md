# Maiimg Influencer Collaboration Image Toolkit

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Influencer campaigns fail when creators receive outdated assets or spend hours hunting for logo files. <strong>Maiimg</strong> centralizes your campaign visuals in a single gallery with access controls, QR distribution, and analytics to confirm every creator is launch-ready.</p>
</div>

## Creator Pain Points

- DMs and email threads filled with multiple file versions
- Large ZIP downloads on mobile
- No clarity on embargo dates or usage rules
- Brand teams can't track which links were opened

## Toolkit Structure

| Section | Contents | Settings |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Campaign Overview | Hero shots, mood boards | View limit 200, expiration launch day |
| Product Close-ups | Packshots, detail frames | Download ON, expiration 30 days |
| Logos & Typography | PNG/SVG logos, color palette | View limit 100, download ON |
| Social Templates | Reels covers, story frames | Download ON, view limit 300 |

## Setup Checklist

1. Batch upload 15–25 assets per gallery (PNG/JPG/WebP)
2. Add short descriptions (e.g., "Use Slide 1 for unboxing intro")
3. Set view limits + expiration to match embargo
4. Generate link + QR for each tier (VIP creators, micro, affiliates)
5. Embed link in onboarding doc + Slack channel pinned message

## Onboarding Email Template

```
Subject: [Brand] Creator Toolkit – Embargo 12/05 10:00 ET

Hi [Creator],
All approved visuals live here: https://maiimg.com/...
QR attached for quick mobile scan.
Guidelines:
- Post no earlier than Dec 5, 10:00 ET
- Use "#BrandPartner" and tag @brand
- Downloads enabled for long-form edits

Analytics help us confirm delivery—ping us if you have trouble accessing.
```

## Analytics to Monitor

- View count per influencer tier → confirms readiness
- Most downloaded assets → replicate for future drops
- Access timestamps → spot late adopters and send nudges
- Geographic/device data → identify creators working on mobile

## Best Practices

- Duplicate the gallery for each language or region
- Include short video snippets (WebP/animated GIF) for reels hooks
- Add instructions at top: usage rights, crediting, color filters to avoid
- Delete gallery after campaign to prevent unauthorized reuse

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Creator sees "limit reached" | Increase view limit or duplicate gallery |
| Needs PSD/AI files | Upload to secondary gallery with password |
| QR blurry on printed kits | Download high-res PNG (1000px+) |

## Results

Brands use Maiimg to deliver influencer kits faster, cut back-and-forth messages, and prove distribution with data. That means more time spent on creative ideation, less on asset logistics.

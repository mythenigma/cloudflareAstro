Smart PDF links should balance two goals: fast recipient access and strong publisher control.

## Conversion-oriented workflow

1. Upload final PDF version.
2. Configure link policy (download, expiry, open limit).
3. Generate link + QR for multi-channel use.
4. Share by audience segment.
5. Review open statistics before follow-up.

## Why links outperform attachments

- Better mobile reading
- No attachment size friction
- Clear version control
- Quick revoke/rotation when scope changes

## Policy presets

### Broad distribution

- Download: on
- Expiry: optional
- Open limit: high

### Sales or partner review

- Download: off
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Open limit: medium

### Confidential material

- Download: off
- Expiry: short
- Open limit: low
- Watermark: Visitor ID

## Final takeaway

If you want better response rates and fewer leaks, use controlled links as default and treat attachments as fallback.

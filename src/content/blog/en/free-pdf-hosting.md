## What You Get

- Upload PDF and share by link.
- QR code for mobile-first distribution.
- Optional controls: view limits, expiry, download restriction.
- Open statistics to support follow-up.

## 4-Step Workflow

1. Upload one PDF for one clear audience.
2. Set policy (views, expiry, optional download restriction).
3. Generate link and QR.
4. Share and review open statistics.

## Recommended Settings by Scenario

| Scenario | View limit | Expiry | Download |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client review | Medium | 7-30 days | Optional |
| Proposal sharing | Low-medium | 3-14 days | Usually off |
| Internal docs | Medium-high | 30-90 days | Optional |
| Event handout | High | 1-14 days | Optional |

## Comparison Mindset

- Public cloud links: broad compatibility, weaker policy control.
- Controlled-sharing platforms: stronger lifecycle control and easier revocation.

## Common Mistakes

- Sharing before setting expiry.
- Reusing one link for unrelated audiences.
- Leaving temporary links active for too long.

## Bottom Line

Free PDF hosting works best when distribution speed is paired with clear access policy and link lifecycle management.

# Share Your Resume Safely: Create a Secure PDF Link

When you're job hunting, your resume is your calling card, but it also contains sensitive personal information. Emailing it as a standard attachment can leave you vulnerable. MaiPDF lets you share your resume as a secure, professional link, giving you full control over your data.

## Why Emailing Your Resume is Risky

*   **No Control**: Once you send an attachment, you can't control who sees it, forwards it, or where it's stored.
*   **Data Privacy**: Your name, address, phone number, and work history are exposed.
*   **Outdated Versions**: If you update your resume, you have to resend it, creating confusion.

## The Smart Way to Share: Use a Secure Link

Using MaiPDF to create a link for your resume solves these problems and adds a layer of professionalism.

### Control Downloads
Enable the "View-Only" mode to prevent recruiters and hiring managers from downloading your resume. They can view it online, but they can't keep a local copy. This is perfect for initial applications, protecting your information until you're further along in the hiring process.

### Always Present the Latest Version
If you spot a typo or want to tailor your resume for a specific job after sending the link, you can! Simply replace the file in your MaiPDF dashboard. The link remains the same, ensuring recruiters always see the most up-to-date version of your resume.

### Look More Professional
A clean, simple link in your email or application looks modern and tech-savvy. It shows you care about your data and presentation, setting you apart from other candidates who just attach a file.

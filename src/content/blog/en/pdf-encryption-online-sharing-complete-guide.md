## Why PDF Encryption Matters

Sharing PDFs online without encryption exposes them to security risks:

**Security Risks:**
- Unencrypted data transmission
- Vulnerable to interception
- Unprotected file storage
- No data confidentiality
- Compliance violations
- Privacy breaches

**Encryption protects against these risks** by securing data at rest and in transit.

## Types of PDF Encryption

### 1. Transport Encryption

**HTTPS Protocol:**
- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure connection required
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Industry standard

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Data encrypted during transmission
- ✅ Secure connection
- ✅ Prevents interception
- ✅ Standard security practice

### 2. Storage Encryption

**Server-Side Encryption:**
- Encrypted file storage
- Key management
- Secure data at rest
- Protection against breaches

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Files encrypted on servers
- ✅ Protection against unauthorized access
- ✅ Secure storage
- ✅ Compliance support

### 3. End-to-End Encryption

**Complete Protection:**
- Encryption from upload to download
- No plaintext at any stage
- Maximum security
- Full data protection

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Maximum security
- ✅ Complete protection
- ✅ No data exposure
- ✅ Highest security level

## How PDF Encryption Works

### Transport Encryption Process

**Step 1: Connection Establishment**
- Client requests secure connection
- Server presents SSL/TLS certificate
- Certificate validation
- Secure channel established

**Step 2: Data Transmission**
- Data encrypted before transmission
- Encrypted data sent over HTTPS
- Server decrypts on receipt
- Secure transmission complete

**Step 3: Protection**
- Data protected in transit
- Cannot be intercepted
- Secure transmission
- Privacy maintained

### Storage Encryption Process

**Step 1: File Upload**
- File uploaded to server
- Encryption initiated
- Encryption keys generated
- File encrypted

**Step 2: Encrypted Storage**
- Encrypted file stored
- Keys managed securely
- Access control enforced
- Secure storage maintained

**Step 3: File Access**
- Access request authenticated
- Decryption keys retrieved
- File decrypted for access
- Secure access provided

# Resume Link Generator: Share Your CV Professionally

Resume links solve three common problems: attachment friction, outdated files, and no visibility into whether your CV was opened.

## Resume link workflow

1. Export a clean one-page or two-page CV PDF.
2. Upload and generate share link.
3. Set expiry for active job-search cycles.
4. Keep one updated version per target role.
5. Reuse the same controlled link in applications.

## Settings that usually work

- Download: on for standard recruiting
- Expiry: 30-60 days
- Open limit: medium/high
- Optional watermark: on for high-privacy CV variants

## Messaging best practice

- Use a short, clear link label in emails
- Add one-line context: target role + key focus
- Include portfolio link separately if needed

## Maintenance routine

- Update CV monthly during active search
- Remove stale links from old applications
- Use open statistics to optimize follow-up timing

## Final takeaway

A professional CV link is simple to open, always current, and easier to manage than sending attachments repeatedly.

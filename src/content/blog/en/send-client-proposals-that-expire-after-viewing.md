# Send Client Proposals That Expire After Viewing

When sharing sensitive business proposals with clients, security should be your top priority. MaiPDF's expiration feature ensures your proposals automatically become inaccessible after viewing, protecting your business strategy and pricing information from unauthorized distribution.

## Why Standard Proposal Sharing Falls Short

Traditional methods of sharing business proposals create security vulnerabilities that can harm your competitive advantage.

**Email Attachments**: Once sent, you lose complete control over the document. Recipients can forward, store, or share your proposal indefinitely.

**Cloud Storage Links**: Generic sharing links often lack proper access controls and can be accidentally shared or remain accessible longer than intended.

**Physical Documents**: While secure during handoff, physical documents can be photocopied or scanned without your knowledge.

## How Expiring Proposals Protect Your Business

**Automatic Expiration**: Set proposals to expire after one viewing, ensuring sensitive information doesn't circulate beyond your intended recipient.

**Access Logging**: Know exactly when your proposal was opened and by whom, providing valuable insights into client engagement.

**Content Protection**: Prevent screenshots and copying with built-in security features that protect your intellectual property.

**Professional Impression**: Demonstrate your commitment to security and professionalism, building trust with potential clients.

## Real Business Impact

**Pricing Protection**: Keep your pricing strategies confidential by ensuring proposals can't be shared with competitors.

**Strategy Security**: Protect detailed project plans and methodologies from being distributed without permission.

**Client Trust**: Show clients you take their confidentiality seriously by implementing professional security measures.

**Competitive Advantage**: Maintain your edge by controlling how long sensitive business information remains accessible.

## Implementation Best Practices

**Set Appropriate Expiration**: For initial proposals, consider 1-2 viewings. For detailed specifications, allow 3-5 views for thorough review.

**Include Instructions**: Let clients know the document expires after viewing and provide contact information for additional access if needed.

**Follow Up Strategically**: Use viewing data to time your follow-up calls and emails effectively.

**Backup Important Proposals**: Keep secure copies of all sent proposals for your records and potential revisions.

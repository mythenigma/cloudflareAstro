# PDF Security Best Practices: Online Sharing

Security quality comes from repeatable policy, not one-off configuration.

## Baseline checklist

- Segment recipients by role
- Set expiry for temporary docs
- Set open limits by audience size
- Disable download/print for sensitive files
- Keep watermark on for high-risk content

## Response checklist

1. Disable compromised links quickly.
2. Reissue links to approved recipients.
3. Review open logs for timeline.
4. Update policy defaults.

## Final takeaway

Simple templates used consistently are the strongest security practice.

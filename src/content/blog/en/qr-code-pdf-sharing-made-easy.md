## 🧠 Why Skip Email?

Email is great, but it’s not always practical:

- **Slow:** Not ideal for live events.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Exposes recipient email addresses.
- **Unreliable:** Messages can get lost or filtered.
- **Connectivity Issues:** Requires everyone to be online.

In contrast, QR codes are:

- **Instant:** Share in seconds.
- **Universal:** Works on any device with a camera.
- **Effortless:** Easy to scan from screens or printed materials.

Perfect for conferences, classrooms, trade shows, and more.

Here’s how you can share PDFs using QR codes:

1. **Upload Your PDF**
   - Use a secure cloud service to host your file.

2. **Generate a Link**
   - Create a view-only link for your PDF.

3. **Create a QR Code**
   - Use a QR code generator to link to your file.

4. **Share the QR Code**

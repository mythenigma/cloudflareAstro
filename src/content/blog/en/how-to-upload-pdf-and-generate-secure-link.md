# How to Upload a PDF and Generate a Secure Link

If you still share PDFs as attachments, you lose version control and distribution control fast. A secure link workflow is cleaner and easier to manage.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. Open MaiPDF and upload your PDF.
2. Set controls: download on/off, open limit, expiry.
3. Enable watermark when the file is sensitive (`Visitor ID`).
4. Generate link and QR.
5. Test once on desktop and mobile before sending.

## Recommended presets

### Public document

- Download: on
- Open limit: high
- Expiry: optional

### Client proposal

- Download: off
- Open limit: 20-50
- Expiry: 7-14 days

### Confidential review

- Download: off
- Open limit: low
- Expiry: 3-7 days
- Watermark: on

## Open statistics to check

- Total opens
- Open trend by time window
- Expired/blocked open attempts

Use this to decide whether to extend, rotate, or disable links.

## Common mistakes

- Sending attachment and secure link at the same time
- Keeping one permanent link for every audience
- No expiry on temporary documents
- No post-send test after replacing file content

## Final takeaway

Upload once, set minimal controls, share one link. This gives better delivery speed and much better control than attachment-based sharing.

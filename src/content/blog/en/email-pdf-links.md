# Email PDF Links Instead of Attachments

Email links reduce delivery failures and simplify document management.

## Email link workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate link.
2. Configure expiry/open-limit/download settings.
3. Insert link with clear label in email body.
4. Follow up based on open statistics timing.

## Why links work better

- No attachment size issues
- Better viewing on mobile
- Cleaner version control
- Easier revoke when needed

## Final takeaway

For business email, link-first sharing is faster, cleaner, and safer than recurring attachments.

## 📊 In-Depth Analysis of Current PDF Security Market

### 🔍 Mainstream PDF Document Encryption Methods

According to **in-depth analysis from the MaiPDF website**, PDF document encryption in the current market is mainly divided into two major categories:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div style="background: #fff7ed; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #f97316;">
<h4 style="color: #ea580c; margin-top: 0;">🖥️ Traditional Desktop Encryption Solutions</h4>
<p><strong>Converting PDF files into desktop executable programs</strong>. This is very suitable for offline PC and MAC computers, where users can double-click the executable program on the desktop to browse the PDF.</p>

<div style="margin: 1rem 0;">
<h5>Three main implementation methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>EXE Program Packaging</strong>: Converting PDF to .exe programs, usually with expiration destruction features</li>
<li><strong>Specialized Format Conversion</strong>: Converting PDF files to special formats (like PDC), using custom software for transcoding and display</li>
<li><strong>System-Level Encryption</strong>: Using file encryption systems for encryption, requiring installation of corresponding decryption software</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="background: #fecaca; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem;">
<strong>❌ Existing Problems</strong>: Complex operations, poor compatibility, software installation required, poor mobile support

## 🛡️ In-Depth Analysis of MaiPDF's Four Core Functions

### 1️⃣ Smart Reading Count Control

<div style="background: #eff6ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

**Core Mechanism**: You can set PDF reading counts. Through limited file reading times, you can both understand how many times the file has been read and prevent others from copying file content through multiple readings. This is the most basic barrier for protecting file data security.

**Enterprise Application Scenarios**:
- 📋 **Tender Documents**: Set 3-5 viewing times to prevent malicious multiple downloads
- 💼 **Business Plans**: Limit access times to control distribution scope
- 🔍 **Audit Reports**: Precisely control viewing personnel and times

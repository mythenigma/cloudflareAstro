# One-Click Share Multiple Images: Gallery Workflow

When sharing many images, a single gallery link is faster and cleaner than sending files one by one.

## Workflow

1. Batch upload images.
2. Generate one gallery link.
3. Apply access/expiry settings.
4. Share link or QR code.
5. Monitor open statistics and retire link when done.

## Best-fit scenarios

- Event and wedding galleries
- Design or photo proofing
- Product launch asset packs
- Internal review boards

## Common mistakes

- Mixing unrelated projects in one gallery
- No expiry for temporary galleries
- Reusing a single link for all audiences

## Final takeaway

One-click gallery sharing saves time, but lifecycle control is what keeps it professional.

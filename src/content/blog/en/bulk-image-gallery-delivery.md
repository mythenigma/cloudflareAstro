# Bulk Image Gallery Delivery: Share a Whole Set Without Chaos

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>When you’re sending dozens (or hundreds) of images, individual links create confusion. A single gallery link creates clarity.</p>
</div>

## The workflow in one pass

<div class="feature-section">
  <div class="feature-content">
    <h3>1) Upload in bulk</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a set</li>
      <li>Batch upload (avoid per-file repeats)</li>
      <li>Confirm the gallery is complete</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-content">
    <h3>2) Share one link</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One URL for the whole set</li>
      <li>Easier to forward inside a team</li>
      <li>Less “which file is missing?”</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
 </div>

## Where this shines

- Event photo delivery
- Product shoots
- Agency handoffs
- Internal content libraries

## Tip

If you’re delivering to clients, add an expiration policy to avoid old galleries lingering forever.

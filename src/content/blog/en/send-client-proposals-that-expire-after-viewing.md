# Send Client Proposals That Expire After Viewing

Proposal links should not stay open forever.  
Use expiry and open limits to protect pricing and strategy content.

## Why Attachments Fail

- Unlimited forwarding
- No practical expiry
- No visibility on opens
- Hard to revoke after send

## Proposal Security Setup

![Security Settings](/maipdf-images/security_setting.png)

1. Upload final proposal PDF.
2. Set expiry (for example, 3-7 days).
3. Set open limit (for example, 2-5 opens).
4. Set download policy (usually OFF for pricing docs).
5. Enable watermark for sensitive bids.
6. Share link with clear instructions.

## Suggested Presets

- First proposal: 3 days, 3 opens, download OFF
- Negotiation round: 7 days, 8 opens, download OFF
- Signed scope recap: 14 days, 20 opens, download ON

## Follow-Up Playbook

- No opens after 48 hours: resend with short CTA
- Many opens from unknown context: tighten limits
- Deal delayed: extend expiry and log changes
- Proposal updated: replace file under same link if supported

Access controls reduce casual leakage but cannot fully stop screenshots or external captures.

## Final Takeaway

For client proposals, use expiring links by default.  
You keep negotiation speed while controlling document exposure.

# PDF Security: How to Set View Limits and Prevent Unauthorized Access

<div class="intro-panel">
  Your PDF contains sensitive information. Once you send it, you lose control—or do you? With modern PDF security features, you can maintain complete control over who views your documents, how many times they're accessed, and even when they expire. <strong>Here's how to protect your PDFs like a pro.</strong>

## 🚨 The PDF Security Crisis

**The cost of poor PDF security**:
- **Data breaches**: Sensitive information exposed
- **Compliance violations**: Regulatory penalties
- **Reputation damage**: Loss of client trust

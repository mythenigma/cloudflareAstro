## Event Delivery Scenarios

| Event Type | Delivery Goal | Distribution Method |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Conferences | Session recaps, keynote highlights | QR codes on screens + email follow-up |
| Trade Shows | Booth photography for exhibitors | Printed QR cards + partner emails |
| Weddings | Same-day preview gallery | QR code at reception, link emailed |
| Brand Activations | Social-ready content for attendees | NFC/QR on swag + SMS blast |

## Workflow Overview

1. Upload day-of selects (up to 25 shots per batch)
2. Configure viewing windows + download permissions
3. Generate QR codes for signage and handouts
4. Email link to VIPs, sponsors, internal teams
5. Monitor access to confirm delivery

## Photographer Toolkit

### Gallery Setup

- Create separate galleries per audience (attendees, VIPs, press)
- Use consistent naming (`EventName_Audience_Date`)
- Include watermark overlays in images if needed

### Access Controls

- **Attendee Gallery**: High view limit, downloads off, 30-day expiration
- **VIP Gallery**: Medium view limit, downloads on, 14-day expiration
- **Press Gallery**: Strict view limit, 7-day expiration, enable downloads
- **Internal Gallery**: Unlimited views, no expiration, password protection

## Organizer Playbook

### Before the Event

- Prepare template galleries per audience
- Design QR signage + cards with placeholders
- Align expiration dates with marketing timeline
- Decide who can download originals

### During the Event

- Upload teaser images after each major session
- Update QR-linked galleries rather than sending new links
- Announce availability via MC, push notifications, or signage
- Provide QR stickers for sponsors to share with guests

### After the Event

- Send follow-up email with gallery link and access instructions
- Export analytics to show sponsor engagement
- Rotate gallery to post-event recap after expiration
- Archive gallery by deleting after deliverables complete

## Analytics Insights

Track key metrics to prove value:

- Total scans and unique viewers
- Peak traffic times (keynote vs. awards)
- Most-viewed images (to inform future coverage)
- Top geographic access (remote attendees)
- Download counts for sponsors/press

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Attendees can’t scan | QR too small or low contrast | Reprint larger, increase contrast |
| Gallery full | 25 image limit reached | Create multiple galleries per day |
| Leaked images | Link forwarded externally | Shorten expiration, enable password |
| Slow loading onsite | Venue Wi-Fi congestion | Encourage cellular data, reduce image size |

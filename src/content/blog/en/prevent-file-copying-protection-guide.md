# How to Prevent File Copying: Practical Protection Guide

No single feature can stop every copy path, but layered controls sharply reduce unauthorized redistribution.

## Control stack

- View-only delivery for sensitive files
- Disable download/print where required
- Set expiry and open limits
- Add Visitor ID watermark for accountability
- Use audience-specific links

## High-risk scenarios

- Paid content distribution
- Contract and legal review
- Internal strategic documents
- Pre-release product material

## Practical workflow

1. Classify document sensitivity.
2. Apply default policy template.
3. Share segmented links.
4. Monitor open logs.
5. Revoke and reissue on abnormal behavior.

## Final takeaway

Copy prevention is an operations discipline. Use consistent defaults and short sharing lifecycles instead of ad hoc settings.

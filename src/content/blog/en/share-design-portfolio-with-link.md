# Share Your Design Portfolio with a Link

Attachments make portfolios harder to manage.  
A single share link is cleaner for both recruiters and clients.

## Why Links Beat Attachments

- Fewer spam and size-limit issues
- One canonical version
- Access can be limited or expired
- Open statistics are visible
- Better viewing on mobile

## Recommended Workflow

1. Export portfolio PDF with clear section titles.
2. Upload to a controlled sharing service.
3. Set policy: expiry date, max opens, optional passcode.
4. Decide download policy (on/off).
5. Send one short message with the link.

## Privacy Controls

- Share privately with selected recipients
- Limit opens (for example, 3-10)
- Add passcode for sensitive projects
- Disable downloads if reuse risk is high
- Review Visitor-ID based open statistics

## Practical Job-Search Use

Apply to multiple studios with one controlled link, then prioritize follow-up based on opens instead of guessing.

## Message Template

```text
Hi [Name], here is my portfolio link:
[LINK]
Access is open until [DATE]. If you prefer, I can also send a project-specific version.
```

## Final Takeaway

For design portfolios, link-first delivery is the professional default: easier access, cleaner updates, and better control.

# Image Link Generator: Free Image URL Workflow

An image link generator should do one thing well: upload images and produce clean URLs you can share anywhere.

## 4-step workflow

1. Upload images in batch.
2. Get direct image URLs and one gallery link.
3. Generate QR if you need offline distribution.
4. Share by channel (email/chat/social/site embed).

## Link types and use cases

- Direct image URL: docs, CMS, product pages
- Gallery link: client review and campaign handoff
- QR link: events, printed materials, store displays

## Practical controls

- Set expiry for temporary campaigns
- Disable link when campaign ends
- Use separate galleries by audience

## Quality checklist before publishing

- Confirm mobile loading speed
- Verify image order in gallery
- Check link behavior in incognito
- Test QR scan distance/contrast for print

## Common mistakes

- One giant gallery for all projects
- No expiry for time-limited assets
- Reusing same public link across regions/campaigns

## Final takeaway

Keep image sharing simple: short workflow, clear link types, and lightweight controls. This gives speed without losing operational control.

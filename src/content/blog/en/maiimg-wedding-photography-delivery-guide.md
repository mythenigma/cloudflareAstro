## Recommended Delivery Structure

| Stage | What to send | Suggested settings |
|---|---|---|
| Sneak peek (24-72h) | 10-15 highlight photos | 7-14 days expiry, medium view limit |
| Main gallery (2-4 weeks) | Full curated set | 60-90 days expiry, higher view limit |
| Vendor pack | Approved subset | Short expiry, optional download enable |

## 4-Step Workflow

1. Split photos into focused galleries (sneak peek, full set, vendor pack).
2. Set expiry and view limits before sharing.
3. Share by link in email/chat and QR code for in-person viewing.
4. Review open statistics and send targeted follow-ups when needed.

## Practical Baseline Settings

- Sneak peek: short expiry, moderate view limit, downloads optional.
- Main gallery: longer expiry, higher view limit, downloads enabled.
- Vendor gallery: separate link and narrower permissions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Sending one oversized mixed gallery.
- Forgetting expiry before publishing links.
- Using the same link for couple, guests, and vendors.
- Skipping mobile testing for link and QR code.

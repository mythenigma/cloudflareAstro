# Distribute Educational Resources with Limited Access

Educational materials often need access for learners while limiting uncontrolled redistribution.

## Practical setup

- Use view limits for assessment-related files
- Set expiry by class schedule or exam window
- Keep download off for sensitive materials
- Use separate links for class groups when needed

## Final takeaway

Educational sharing works best when access rules match teaching context and timeline.

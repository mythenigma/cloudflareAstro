# Fast PDF Sharing: Generate Secure Links with Download Control

Fast sharing should also be controlled sharing.

## 60-Second Workflow

1. Upload the PDF.
2. Generate share link or QR code.
3. Choose `view-only` or `download enabled`.
4. Add expiry and open limit if needed.
5. Test once on phone and desktop, then send.

## Policy Presets

- Sales proposal: download OFF, 7-day expiry, 20 opens
- Internal review: download OFF, 3-day expiry, 10 opens
- Public factsheet: download ON, long expiry, no open limit

## Final Takeaway

Use fast links, but always pair them with policy controls.  
That is the balance between speed, user experience, and document safety.

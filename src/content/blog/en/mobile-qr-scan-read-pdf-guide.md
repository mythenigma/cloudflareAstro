# How to Make PDFs Scannable with Mobile QR Codes

QR-based PDF access removes download friction and improves offline-to-online conversion.

## Quick setup

1. Upload PDF and generate link.
2. Create QR code from the link.
3. Set expiry/open-limit/download policy.
4. Test scan on iOS and Android.
5. Publish on print or digital channels.

## Best scenarios

- Event agendas and handouts
- Product manuals and onboarding docs
- Training materials in classrooms
- Store or venue information cards

## Quality checklist

- QR contrast and size are print-safe
- Mobile first-page load is acceptable on 4G
- Fallback short URL is displayed under QR
- Link policy matches document sensitivity

## Final takeaway

QR-to-PDF is the fastest path to mobile reading. Keep controls simple and test in real devices before release.

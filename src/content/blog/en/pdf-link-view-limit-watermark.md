# PDF Link View Limit and Watermark: Practical Dual Control

View limits and watermarks solve different problems and work best together.

![PDF Settings Interface](/2025MayMaiPDF/settings_in_cloudshare.png)

## What each control does

- View limit: caps how many times a link can be opened
- Watermark: increases accountability for screenshots and redistribution

## Recommended combinations

### External review

- View limit: medium
- Expiry: 7-14 days
- Watermark: on

### Confidential documents

- View limit: low
- Expiry: short
- Download: off
- Watermark: required

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Set view limit + expiry.
3. Enable Visitor ID watermark.
4. Share segmented links.
5. Revoke and reissue when needed.

## Final takeaway

Use dual control by default for sensitive files: limit access volume and add clear accountability signal.

## Important Notes

### Limitations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can users still view documents after disabling downloads?

**A:** Yes. Disabling downloads only prevents saving files. Users can still view the complete document content online.

### Q2: How to know if someone tried to download?

**A:** You can check user access behavior through access records, but cannot completely detect all download attempts.

### Q3: Does disabling downloads affect document loading speed?

**A:** No. The disable download feature does not affect document loading speed.

### Q4: Can I temporarily allow downloads after disabling them?

**A:** No. Once you set disable download, you cannot modify this property. If you need to allow downloads, you need to re-upload the PDF and generate a new share link.

### Q5: Can I still print after disabling downloads?

**A:** No. The disable download feature automatically disables printing. If printing were allowed, users could save the document as a PDF file through "Print to PDF", which is equivalent to downloading. Therefore, disabling downloads and disabling printing are linked and cannot be set separately.

## Summary

The disable download feature for PDF share links is an important tool for protecting document security. By disabling downloads, you can:

- ✅ Prevent documents from being saved and forwarded
- ✅ Maintain control over documents
- ✅ Simplify document management process
- ✅ Protect sensitive information

Remember, disabling downloads is not a panacea. It's recommended to combine with other security measures such as password protection, access restrictions, and watermarks to build a multi-layered document protection system.

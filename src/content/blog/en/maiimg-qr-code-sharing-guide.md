## Where to share QR codes

- **Print**: posters, flyers, business cards, product packaging.
- **Digital**: slides, PDFs, websites, social media posts.
- **On-site**: event signage, reception desks, retail displays.

## Match the QR code to the channel

- **Print**: use a large, high-contrast QR code and test at distance.
- **Digital**: avoid compression artifacts; use the original PNG.
- **Mobile-first**: place the QR code in the first screen when possible.

## Recommended sharing flow

1. Generate the QR code in Maiimg.
2. Validate access settings with a test scan.
3. Publish to the target channel.
4. Monitor access data and update settings if needed.

## Security and access tips

- Use view limits for temporary campaigns.
- Add verification for sensitive galleries.
- Update or revoke access without changing the QR code.

## Use cases to highlight value

- **Event photos**: share a gallery instantly with attendees.
- **Product launches**: attach a QR code to packaging or posters.
- **Portfolios**: include in resumes or printed cards.
- **Real estate**: place on property signs for quick viewing.

## Key takeaways

- Sharing is about placement, size, and clarity.
- A single QR code can serve multiple channels when the link is stable.
- Access controls let you keep distribution flexible but secure.

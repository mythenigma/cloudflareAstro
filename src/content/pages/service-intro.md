# A minimalist PDF link generator

Share PDF documents through secure links without the complexity of traditional file sharing platforms.

## How it works

Upload your PDF document and receive a unique sharing link. Recipients can view the document directly in their browser without downloading additional software or creating accounts.

## Simple access controls

### View limits
Set how many times your link can be opened. Once the limit is reached, the link becomes inactive. This prevents unlimited sharing while ensuring your intended recipients can access the content.

### Download permissions
Choose whether recipients can download the PDF file. You can restrict access to view-only mode, keeping the document secure while still making it accessible.

### No registration barrier
Recipients don't need to create accounts or provide personal information. They simply click the link and view the document immediately.

## Privacy and storage

### Temporary hosting
Files are not permanently stored on our servers. Most links expire automatically within 24 hours, ensuring your documents don't remain accessible indefinitely.

### No user accounts
The service operates without requiring user registration. Upload, configure, and share without creating yet another online account.

### Automatic cleanup
Links and associated files are removed from our systems according to the expiration settings you choose, maintaining both security and privacy.

## Use cases

Share reports, proposals, or contracts with specific viewing limitations.

**Personal files**

**Temporary sharing**  
Provide quick access to documents that don't need permanent availability.

The process takes less than a minute and requires no technical knowledge or account setup.

# Turn Any PDF into a QR Code

QR delivery removes friction for mobile readers and makes offline distribution easier.

## Fast workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Generate link and QR code.
3. Set download/expiry/open limit.
4. Test scan on iOS and Android.
5. Publish to print or digital touchpoints.

## High-value use cases

- Event handouts and agendas
- Product instructions in packaging
- Property and retail information cards
- Training and classroom materials

## Release checklist

- QR size/contrast fits print distance
- Mobile open speed is acceptable
- Fallback short URL included
- Link policy matches file sensitivity

## Final takeaway

PDF-to-QR is best when speed matters. Keep settings simple and test real scan paths before launch.

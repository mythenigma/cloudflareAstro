# Replace Email Attachments: Modern PDF Sharing for Business

Attachment workflows create repeated friction: size limits, version confusion, and no post-send control.

## Link-first replacement workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate share link.
2. Apply policy (download, expiry, open limit).
3. Paste link into email with clear title.
4. Use same controlled link for follow-ups.

## Why this improves operations

- No attachment size failures
- Better mobile viewing experience
- One current document version
- Faster revoke/rotation when needed

## Final takeaway

Use attachments as fallback only. Make controlled links the default for external and internal PDF distribution.

# View Limits and Expiration: Simple Controls That Prevent Oversharing

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Most leaks aren’t “hacks”—they’re links that live too long and spread too far. Limits and expiration shrink that window.</p>
</div>

![View limit flow](/diagram/en/simple-view-limit-flow.svg)

## How the control works

- You set a maximum number of opens (or a time window)
- The link works until the rule is reached
- After that, access stops automatically

## When it’s especially useful

- One-time proposals
- Temporary access to manuals or onboarding docs
- Sharing drafts that change frequently

## A practical baseline policy

| Document type | Expiration | View limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proposal / quote | 7–14 days | 10–30 |
| Draft contract | 3–7 days | 5–15 |
| Training material | 30–60 days | unlimited or high |

## Tip

Combine limits with verification if you want “each view to be accountable,” not just counted.

# Offline PDF Package Distribution: Best Practices for Secure Offline Document Sharing

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Most offline-sharing issues come from weak distribution process, not from package generation itself.</p>

## Pre-Distribution Checklist

- Confirm package version and integrity.
- Confirm recipient list and delivery channel.
- Define validity window and update owner.
- Prepare recipient instructions in plain steps.

## Distribution Methods

| Method | Strength | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Secure file transfer | Controlled handoff | Recipient friction |
| Internal shared drive | Team convenience | Version drift if unmanaged |
| Physical transfer media | Network-independent | Device compatibility checks needed |

## Recipient Instructions Template

1. Download/copy package completely.
2. Extract to local folder.
3. Open start file as instructed.
4. Do not rename core files.
5. Use provided support contact if blocked.

## Frequent Failure Modes

- Mixed versions sent to different recipients.
- Missing extraction/open instructions.
- No owner for updates and re-issues.

## Bottom Line

Offline package distribution should be treated like release management: controlled versioning, clear owner, clear recipient path.

# Industry-Specific PDF Security: Practical Sector Templates

Different sectors need different defaults. One generic PDF policy usually fails in real operations.

## Recommended sector templates

### Healthcare

- Verification: strict
- Download: mostly off
- Expiry: short for patient-related docs
- Open logs: required for audit support

### Finance and legal

- Download: off by default
- Expiry: strict
- Open limit: low/medium
- Watermark: required for high-value docs

### Education

- Download: mixed by material type
- Expiry: aligned to course calendar
- Open limit: medium/high

### Architecture and design

- Download: off for concept-stage materials
- Expiry: phase-based
- Watermark: on for client-exclusive drafts

## Final takeaway

Start with sector templates, then refine per team. Policy consistency matters more than feature complexity.

# Best Practices for Securing PDF Links and QR Codes

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, securing your PDF documents and QR codes is more important than ever. Whether you're sharing sensitive business information, personal documents, or creative content, implementing proper security measures is essential for protecting your data.

## Understanding Security Risks

### Common Threats

- **Unauthorized Access**: Unintended viewers accessing your documents
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive information being shared without permission
- **Link Manipulation**: URLs being modified to bypass security
- **QR Code Spoofing**: Fake codes leading to malicious content

## Essential Security Measures

### 1. Access Control

- **View Limits**: Set maximum number of views
- **Expiration Dates**: Automatically revoke access after a set time
- **Email Verification**: Require email confirmation before access
- **IP Restrictions**: Limit access to specific locations

### 2. Document Protection

- **Download Restrictions**: Control whether documents can be saved
- **Printing Controls**: Limit or prevent document printing
- **Watermarking**: Add visible identifiers to deter sharing
- **Screen Capture Prevention**: Block screenshot functionality

## Best Practices for PDF Links

### 1. Link Management

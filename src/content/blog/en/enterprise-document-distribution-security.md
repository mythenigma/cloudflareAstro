# Enterprise Document Distribution: A Practical Security Workflow

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Enterprise distribution isn’t “send a PDF and hope.” It’s a repeatable workflow: define access, deliver safely, and keep a record of what happened.</p>
</div>

## The workflow (what the diagram captures)

<div class="feature-section">
  <div class="feature-content">
    <h3>1) Prepare</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Classify</strong>: public vs internal vs confidential</li>
      <li><strong>Decide audience</strong>: named recipients or open access</li>
      <li><strong>Set the “default minimum”</strong>: start restrictive, loosen only when needed</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-content">
    <h3>2) Control</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verification</strong>: email/phone/password depending on risk</li>
      <li><strong>Limits</strong>: view count and expiration to reduce leak window</li>
      <li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: download/print prevention where appropriate</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## What to standardize (so this scales)

- **A reusable policy template** per document type (HR, legal, sales, training)
- **A review step** for high-risk documents (two-person rule)
- **An emergency stop** (ability to disable access quickly)

## Common failure modes

| Failure | What happens | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Anyone with the link” access | forwarding spreads access | add verification + expiration |
| Permanent links | old versions keep circulating | use short-lived links + replace content |
| No access records | no audit trail | enable logging/export |

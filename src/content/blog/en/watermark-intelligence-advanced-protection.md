# Watermark Intelligence: Advanced PDF Protection

Dynamic watermarking is most effective when paired with access lifecycle controls.

## What makes it useful

- Visitor-specific watermark context
- Persistent accountability in screenshots
- Faster investigation when redistribution occurs

## Deployment baseline

- Enable watermark for sensitive docs
- Keep expiry + open limits active
- Use audience-specific links

## Final takeaway

Watermarking is a strong deterrent layer, not a standalone control.

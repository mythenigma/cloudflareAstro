# PDF Link Generator: Professional Sharing Workflow

A professional PDF link workflow should reduce friction for recipients and reduce risk for publishers.

## Core workflow

1. Upload PDF and generate link.
2. Apply policy (download, expiry, open limit).
3. Share by audience segment.
4. Use open statistics to plan follow-up.
5. Disable or rotate links when scope changes.

## Use cases

- Sales proposals and quotes
- Contract and legal review
- Team policy and training docs
- Portfolio and resume sharing

## Why this works better than attachments

- Consistent version access
- Better mobile readability
- Faster revoke capability
- Clearer post-send visibility

## Final takeaway

PDF link generation is not just convenience. It is the base layer for controlled, scalable document operations.

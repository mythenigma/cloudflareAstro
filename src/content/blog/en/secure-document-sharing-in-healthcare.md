# Secure Document Sharing in Healthcare

Healthcare sharing must balance quick access with strict privacy controls.

## Recommended healthcare baseline

- Verification before document access
- Download restrictions for sensitive records
- Expiry windows for temporary sharing
- Open logs for audit support

## Typical use cases

- Lab result handoff
- Referral and care coordination files
- Insurance/claims documentation

## Final takeaway

Healthcare document sharing should be policy-led: identity checks, minimal access window, and auditable activity.

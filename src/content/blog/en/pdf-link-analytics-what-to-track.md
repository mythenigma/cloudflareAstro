# PDF Link Analytics: What to Track After You Share

<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Sharing is easy. Knowing what happened next is what makes links useful.</p>

## The 3 signals that matter most

- **When** it was opened (timing your follow-up)
- **How often** it was opened (interest vs. confusion)
- **Where/which device** opened it (basic risk checks)

## A simple workflow

1. Share the link
2. Watch the first open
3. Follow up with context (“Saw you opened it—any questions?”)

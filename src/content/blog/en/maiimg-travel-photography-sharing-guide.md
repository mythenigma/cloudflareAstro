<div class="intro-panel">
  <p>Travel galleries need two things: easy sharing and clear control. Maiimg gives both in a lightweight workflow.</p>
</div>

## Where It Fits Best

- Family trip updates.
- Travel blog companion galleries.
- Event or group-trip photo drops.
- Portfolio previews for clients.

## 4-Step Travel Workflow

1. Group photos by place or day (one topic per gallery).
2. Upload selected images and set expiry/view limits.
3. Share by link and QR code.
4. Review open statistics and adjust your next share.

## Suggested Settings by Scenario

| Scenario | View limit | Expiry | Downloads |
|---|---|---|---|
| Family updates | Medium | 30-60 days | Optional |
| Blog companion gallery | High | 60-180 days | Usually off |
| Team trip coordination | Medium | 7-30 days | Optional |
| Portfolio preview | Medium | 30-90 days | Usually off |

## Practical Tips

- Keep each gallery to a single story arc.
- Name galleries clearly (`Location + Date + Theme`).
- Use shorter expiry for temporary shares.
- Put QR codes where viewers already are (slides, print cards, guides).

## Common Mistakes

- Uploading too many mixed photos in one gallery.
- Setting no expiry for temporary trip content.
- Sharing without testing on mobile first.

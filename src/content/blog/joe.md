When it comes to showcasing your work, especially for designers or anyone in creative fields, sharing a physical portfolio just isn’t the most efficient method anymore. Instead, generating a PDF link is a modern solution that allows you to share your work instantly, securely, and without limits.

## 🚀 Introducing MaiPDF

**MaiPDF** is a secure platform designed for sharing PDF files with advanced access control and protection features. Whether you're sending confidential documents or professional portfolios, MaiPDF gives you full control over who can view, download, or interact with your files.

## Why PDF Protection Matters

Sharing PDFs online without protection creates multiple security vulnerabilities:

**Security Risks:**

- No tracking of who accessed documents
- Intellectual property theft
- Compliance violations

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- PDFs can be downloaded and saved
- Links can be shared indefinitely
- No access control or authentication
- No tracking or monitoring
- Documents remain accessible forever
- No way to revoke access

**PDF protection solves these problems** by implementing multiple security layers.

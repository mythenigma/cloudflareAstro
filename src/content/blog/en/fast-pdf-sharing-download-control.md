## Download Control Options

One of MaiPDF's most useful features is download control. When sharing your PDF, you can choose whether recipients should be able to download the file or only view it online.

**View-Only Mode**: Perfect for presentations, reports, or sensitive documents where you want to maintain control. Viewers can read the content, zoom in and out, and navigate through pages, but cannot save the file locally.

**Download Enabled**: Choose this option when you want recipients to keep a copy of the document for their records or offline use.

This flexibility is particularly valuable for:
- Business proposals that should remain confidential
- Educational materials with usage restrictions
- Draft documents that might change
- Sensitive information requiring access control

## Enhanced Reading Experience

MaiPDF has significantly improved its document loading speeds, making the reading experience much faster and smoother. Documents now load quickly, even for larger files with multiple images or complex formatting.

The enhanced performance means:
- **Faster initial loading**: Documents appear within seconds of clicking the link
- **Smooth page navigation**: No delays when scrolling through multi-page documents
- **Better image rendering**: High-quality images load efficiently without affecting overall performance
- **Responsive viewing**: Documents adapt well to different screen sizes and devices

- Toggle download permissions on or off
- Set access limits by number of views
- Monitor who has accessed your documents
- Update sharing settings even after the link has been distributed

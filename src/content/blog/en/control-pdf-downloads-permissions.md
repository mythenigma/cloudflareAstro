# Control PDF Access: Enable or Disable Downloads

Download permission should follow document purpose, not habit.

## Recommended policy

- Draft/confidential docs: download off
- Final handoff/reference docs: download on
- Always pair with expiry/open limits where relevant

## Workflow

1. Upload PDF.
2. Set download mode.
3. Add lifecycle controls.
4. Share and monitor open logs.

## Final takeaway

Download control is a key policy switch. Use it deliberately per scenario.
